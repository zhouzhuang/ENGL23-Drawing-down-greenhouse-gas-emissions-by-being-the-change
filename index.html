When I was reading “Be The Change” I couldn’t help but think of my parents. They were recently deported to Mexico. I went to visit them in the Spring and was shocked at how drastically their lifestyles changed. Both of my parents used to drive their own cars, and now they share one for when they visit my dad’s land about 45 minutes from their house. My dad went from commuting 2 hours a day, to now mostly walking to the farmer’s market and butcher shop. 
<br><br>
The reason I thought of them however, was because of Peter’s choice not to use a dryer. When I visited their house they didn’t have a dryer, my parents dried all the clothes outside. They don’t even have a washer, and instead hand wash everything. I thought about how drastically my parent’s carbon emissions changed because of where they live, and I thought about how the life that they currently live still fulfills the same necessities as the ones they were living in the U.S. My parents didn’t have the choice to switch over to a more sustainable lifestyle like Peter and his wife did; they were forced to by an unjust system. We do have the choice to. As Ken has stated before, these are first world solutions to first world problems.
<br><br>

My biggest takeaway from this class thus far is to recognize our privilege as students at UCSB. Even if we don’t feel like the 1%, we are. Globally, we wreak environmental havoc and let the Global South suffer because of our greed. Learning in this class about sustainable living is a privilege. We must take it into practice so that we use our privilege for good. We cannot be complicit in the most catastrophic environmental crisis of all time.

Hi Jessica, thank you for sharing your personal story and bringing a different view on this topic. I completely agree with you when you say that we are the 1%. We are single-handedly abusing every resource, commodity, luxury, etc. without batting a single eye at the damage it’s doing. I also think you are right in that we are using our privilege for the wrong things. We have the option to change our lifestyle into something much more sustainable and eco-friendly, but most of us choose to acquire more stuff to add on to the hundreds of things that we already own. We are using our privilege to feed our greed for material things and not putting nearly as much effort in finding ways to change our lifestyles. 
 <br><br>
Kalmus’ book this week gave me some hope because he really made it sound almost easy to switch over into a much more environmentally friendly lifestyle. What was even more convincing was the fact that he also became happier in the process. His book sent a strong message by actually quantifying and graphing out his emissions and his change in emissions throughout his journey. It was impressive to see how much of a change he can make through tweaking minor things in his life. Like you said, even though he didn’t have all of the things that the average American has, he was still able to fulfill his daily necessities without much of any trouble. Kalmus’ dedication to making a change definitely sparked something within me, and I hope it did the same for the rest of our class.

Thank you for sharing the story of your parents. While they were unfortunately forced to drastically change to a more environmentally friendly lifestyle, the majority of Americans are continuing to hurt the environment through unnecessary consumerism and unsustainable behavior. Like you said, we are part of the 1% who are both lucky to be educated in climate change and also have the resources and position to do something about it. While many might think individual action is irrelevant in the big picture, one change can lead to differences in friends, family, and communities. To make an impact, we need to start following Kalmus' lead and influence others to live a more sustainable life by leading through example. 
<br><br>


I liked how Kalmus introduced a way to quantitatively measure our carbon emissions. For most, one's emissions are an arbitrary number, making it hard to actually start taking action since we can't see the difference we make, nor can we see the harmful gases that we each contribute to the atmosphere. While measuring one's emissions doesn't directly make a difference, it can be an important first step for many who are trying to better the environment.

Thank you for sharing the story about your parents. Living in America, almost every one of the tasks that we have fit into our daily routine expends more energy than necessary. We have taken it upon ourselves to make every available luxury a necessity in our lives. Your parents unfortunate experience demonstrates that other parts of the world/ other cultures don't have an obsession with using excess energy and products, like Americans do. Your parents also have proven that it is possible to make the switch from a highly unsustainable/ consumer-based life to a sustainable one. I also agree with you that because we have the opportunity to learn about the importance of living a sustainable life, we hold the responsibility of acting on our knowledge.  I particularly enjoyed this week's reading because it allowed me to crunch the numbers and see exactly which parts of my life were responsible for the most carbon emissions. This way I can see what parts of my life I need to change to live more sustainably.

Thanks for sharing your story. I can’t even imagine what this has been like for you and I hope that you’re doing ok. That’s very interesting to think about; how their carbon emissions have drastically declined but not by choice. Unlike them however, we do have that choice and need to act now. Like you said, we are in that 1% and need to start acting and making changes before the ramifications of climate change become too severe. We have the option to switch, and this reading made it sound simple which was inspiring. However, being a part of that 1% as you mentioned, puts us in a privileged position in which unfortunately we tend to abuse and overuse resources, but we also have the power in our own very hands to begin changing that.

Hi Jessica, I really like how you relate your parents’ experience to the topic of this week, and I totally agree with you. We have to admit that people like us, who are living in the most developed country, have a lot of privileges that those who live in  developing countries don’t have. For instance, it’s common to see dishwashers in US families, but in China, where my parents live, most people still wash dishes by hands and they don’t think a dishwasher is necessary for their life. The easier access to latest technology in the US, which is the “privilege” we have, has brought both positive and negative effects to our life and environment. While we are enjoying the convenience that brought by developed technologies, we are harming our planet at the same time. Taking this class really made me reflect about my lifestyle, and I soon realized how much work we need to do in order to keep our planet sustainable for our next generations.



<br><Hr>
I would first like to say that I am sorry your parents were deported, I have felt the pain of family members being deported and it must be very difficult without them. In regards to your comment, Mexican communities and lifestyles are so drastically different in so many scenarios, my grandparents wash by hand and dry by hanging clothes outside. Cars are used but minimally and the lifestyle that they live is so much lower in carbon emissions. The conscious choice to switch for carbon infused lifestyle to a smaller one is not is admirable but for most people in the world there is no choice to make. 
<br><br>

I made a comment awhile about minimalism and how it is great to be able to make that choice but most people do not have the choice to make it one, especially in poorer countries where there is not a lot of things available to others. The choices that we make even including with our lavish lifestyle are not always our own but sometimes choices forced by the hands of others and I feel like this choice to be more environmentally conscious needs to be encouraged by our government. 
<br><br>

We have such immense privilege that countries view us as the dream place to live, people die trying to get here and even when people get here they are met with racist and unjust treatment that they face everyday. This country is idolized and put on a pedestal for greatness but really this country has immense greed. I completely agree that we must take sustainable living as a privilege and start making real change to help our environment.



<br><Hr>
Your comparison is really what we should all be focusing on. The fact that Peter and his wife chose their new lifestyle has much less of an effect in our call to action than if we were to think about being forced into this lifestyle. You are definitely right that we do not think or feel like we are the 1% and therefore do not act like it. But when we really look closely into the world around us, we see how privileged we are and how much we truly take our lives for granted. I think that we need leaders in society to make big changes like outlawing the use of something as simple as a dryer which would overall make a pretty big impact on the carbon emissions and have close to zero effects on our overall lifestyle. Compared to what people in different parts of the world have to endure on a daily basis, that would be nothing for us yet we are so selfish and stuck in our ways that people aren't going to make a change this little without much larger influence to do so. 
<br><br>

One thing Peter mentioned was about the need for people to witness change in order to shift culture which i completely agree with but we still need enough people to change in order for anyone to witness it and we are not there yet. I think it is a great statement but its one of those easier said than done type of things and i think that we need to dig deeper into finding solutions that aren't just based on letting people do what they want and hope that it spreads. And most of all, if we do p=follow this model, we need big people in the world to be the ones witnessed because mass change is not going to happen by someone simply seeing their neighbor change, unfortunately.

Hi Jessica, thank you for sharing your story. I personally know your pain since my dad was deported once too. It was an immense pain that was difficult to overcome but it also taught to me to appreciate the privileges we as first generation Americans have. Compared to our parent’s and grandparents lives we have everything, fast food, internet and cable, cars, trains, instant hot water for baths and showers and a chance for an education. Something I learned in this class is that the American Dream, our parent’s dream is entirely material wealth based. Our parent’s may wish only the best for us but being raised in a society in which bigger cars and diamond rings are glorified is not happiness guaranteed. I believe we should glorify sustainable living instead. As soon to be educated and productive members of society I agree that we should use our privilege, one that our parents worked so hard to give us, for good. We cannot remain complicit to the damage that is being done to our planet. Again thank you for sharing your story, remain strong sis 



<br><Hr>
First of all, I'm sorry your parents were deported. Thank you for sharing your story with us. I agree that we must recognize our privilege as students here and acknowledge the impact we have on people all over the world. This is why I plan on using what I have learned in this class and all of my other environmental classes in my life even after I leave the Santa Barbara area when I graduate. I will do my best to make sustainable choices, even if I am just choosing between taking a plane or a train to visit my father across the country. I will also do my best to educate people I know about making sustainable choices in a noninvasive way; that is, I will lead by example.

Some of the ways he discussed lowering emissions are impossible for me right now, like switching to solar, driving an electric car, and composting in a yard. But I will keep these things in mind as I go through my daily life. If I ever have the opportunity to own my own home in sunny California, I will install solar panels and grow food in my back yard. I will do my best to use my privilege for good.




<br><Hr>

First off just like to say sorry to hear that, but I am glad they are doing fine. However, I can relate to the points mentioned above because at my grandmas house in San Jose she also lives that sort of lifestyle. She does use a washer, but she drys her clothes outside with the sun. Plus, she has a lemon tree, grows her own vegetables that she uses for a lot of her Mexican dishes. 
<br><br>
But anyways, I feel like it the lifestyle we are living right now, here at the United States, a lot of it is unnecessary, like basic necessities doesn't even exist anymore. And you are right, we are part of that 1% if you think about it, because we have so much privilege without even thinking about it. Maybe back home where I come from I felt like I didn't but then coming here at UCSB,  I know I am. 
<br><br>
I am not saying we have to do exactly what Peter did, but he does set a leading example of the changes we can do in our daily lives to go back to living with the basic necessities and ignoring all the other extra unnecessary things. I feel like American society and social media plays a major role in the way we live life and it's going to be hard to get away from it, but I know we can do it, if we all do our part.



<br><Hr>
I agree with your viewpoint on this matter. We are a very lucky group of individuals that attend UCSB (or any college for that matter) and it is selfish that we would take advantage of this. It is up to us to be the change we want to see in the world because we are the ones that are lucky enough to be able to further our education and understanding of the climate crisis. If we set the example, people will follow.

I think the author organized his book in a quite clear way. As we can see, first the individual efforts and then the collective efforts. I stand by his side when he introduces individual efforts, because I would think it is quite objective, especially when he took his own experiences as an example, he also said that everyone is different and not everyone had the large flight carbon footprint as he did. Additionally, what he says about changes in daily lives were quite detailed including the changing of solar panels and electric-consuming light bulbs. One thing that impressed me most is his reasoning about rubbish landfill, which produces 1.4 megatons of co2 per year. This point is rarely heard in material prior to this reading, since many experts might think the rubbish sorting program is quite mature here in the US. From the perspective of collective efforts, he mentioned the carbon fee instead of the tax. There was no doubt that with the idea of returning the fee back to people can appeal to conservative republicans better than simply a tax, but I think the problem is, with this fee, those who consume a lot of gases are actually harmed by the fee as they hand in much while getting only some back. Therefore, I do not think those people in climate-denying regions, also heavily oil-addicted regions, will find the idea acceptable. Considering the author’s idea that this will not harm the economy, I just do not understand. Since people all tend to consume less oil with the hope to get more profits, the market, the demand of oil, is shrinking and those interests may not want to see the future. Therefore, the fee is equally hard to carry out. However, I agree that cap and trade is stupid and rather crude plan for co2 reduction. The enforcement cannot draw much motivation and is hard to get support from people.

Hello Jessica, thank you for sharing your personal story. First of all, I want to say that government actions like the one imposed to your parents should not be permitted. I have noticed that depending on the place where you live, you have a drastically change of life as you have described with your parents in Mexico. I have relatives in Mexico who live under similar circumstances, and they are happy. They walk to the plaza; they walk to work, and they include many vegetables to their diets. Sadly, women in Mexico are experiencing terrible things that affect their daily lives and make them live in constant fear. In fact, tomorrow, many women across the nation will not go to work, to school in order to simulate what is happening to other women in Mexico. I believe that is the government duty to enforce more laws to protect women so they can be safe and be able to walk from work back to their homes safely. We have to be the change to have a better future. Not only should we focus on being the change in the environmental aspect of our lives but also being the change for a safer, greener and better political system. Kalmus did a great job on explaining his contribution to reduce his personal greenhouse emissions and for us to see how we can do the same. It is just amazing that he was able to reduce his CO2 emissions by a factor of ten and still be happy with his life. As he mentions, we need to make a conscious effort to reduce our greenhouse emissions. We need to do this with self-conviction and not because we are forced to. No one likes to be forced in order to do something, and we should avoid that as it will damage our lives. We live in a society full of addictions; addition to cars, addiction to materialism, addiction to money, addiction to bigger and greater things. If we do not change what fulfills our lives, we will perish as society. As Ken mentioned on his video, Kalmus do not just focus on solutions that we as an individual are unable to achieve but he rather focuses on what it can be done, easily and efficiently. The fact that we can recreate his actions should encourage us to try them. Everyone emits different amounts of Co2 to the atmosphere depending on their social status, place in the world, and daily lives. We need to reflect about what we do now and progressively change to better things.

Thank you for sharing your story. I agree with your comment about how we are very privileged in the sense that we have a lot of resources at our disposal and although we have the chance to try to change our lifestyle for the betterment of the planet we choose not to since we don't want an inconvenience in our daily lives. Yet a lot of people are forced to make these changes and adapt to them. This reminds me of the statement made about how the top 1% of the wealthy people are producing the most carbon emissions yet the people who produce the least are the most are being affected. There are definitely some changes in the way our society is set up. I think the implementation of redistribution of wealth and the carbon fee with the dividend would be a good start.

Hi Jessica, thank you for sharing your story and I hope you and your family are doing okay! My family, by choice fortunately, has also drastically changed their lifestyle in the last couple of years. My mom started composting at home, she no longer uses the dryer and instead only line-dries everything, she shops for our produce at the local farmer’s market, and no longer buys any meat products, although we still consume dairy from local producers. She also sold the second family car and chooses to commute to work everyday, even though she could drive to work to be more comfortable. All of these changes have made my family’s life change a lot for the better; they have reduced their expenses, lost weight and become more active and they feel better about what they are putting out into the world, they feel like they are actively making a change. 
<br><br>
 
I think my mom is a great example of what Gen X’s and boomers need to start changing in their lives. These are small things that benefit the environment and themselves. She spends a lot less time in traffic and a lot less money on things that aren’t essential, which enables her to save money to retire earlier, which to me is the dream goal of anyone from her generation.

It is unfortunate to see that your parents were being deported back to Mexico. And the change in their lifestyle makes me feel so related. When you talk about they dry their clothes outside, I feel so familiar. Before I came to the United States, I have no clue about the dryer machine. I was wondering where does my host parents dry their clothes. In China, we never use the dryer machine. We believe that it is important to air the clothes to dry. Because the sun will kill the gems and it is protecting the clothes' texture. Now, I realized that the negative effects of those technologies. The dryer and the dishwasher are not common in most Asian countries. 

<br><br>

Moreover, the book "Being the change" reminds of my life when I was a child. I was living in a really small city with my grandparents. My grandparents live a highly environmental-friendly lifestyle until now. They always handwash their clothes and air them to dry. Since it is a small city, they walk me to school, and they walk to walk; basically, they walk to anywhere in that small city. Now, look back, the carbon footprint for my grandparents' family is extremely slow due to their lifestyle. Your parent's lifestyle reminds of them. I am like you now, live in a big city now with the benefits of modern technologies.

<br><br>

YES, we are lucky to be 1 percent. And from that, we should start to make changes in our lives.




<br><Hr>
This is really well said and such an important point. Our privilege as students here goes beyond comfortable housing, good food, clean air, beautiful location, health care, and technology -- we are privileged because of the education we have access to. This class especially should not be taken for granted. The truth is that a large percentage of the world's youth will never be in a position to educate themselves on climate change, and even if they could, there would be little they could do to control and change the environment around them. Not only are we here, enrolled in this class, and able to spend our time studying and attending lecture, we live in America, a "free country." Whatever else is wrong with our nation, as Americans we do have some opportunity to initiate change. This is not true in all cultures. 
<br><br>

While it is true that Peter Kalmus proposes first world solutions for first world problems, that doesn't make them any less important and necessary. These "first-world problems" are in a different category than most (we aren't talking about slow internet connection or messing up nails right after leaving the salon). The first world problems Kalmus addresses have huge implications for society and the planet and we need to think deeply about how to act on them. We have the ability and power not only to come up with solutions but to put them into practice.



<br><Hr>
Woah. I think this is a very interesting perspective of what is going on with climate change. Realizing that maybe we don't need all the luxuries that we have I think is the first step to changing our lifestyles for the better. It sucks that your parents got deported yet it's cool to learn that they are taking a step in a better direction in terms of emissions and climate change. I think that more of UCSB needs to realize their privlege and the fact that most of the time we take all the things we have for granted.



<br><Hr>
I like your mention of doing the laundry by hand. It brings up a point that I think is very important: people across the world do things differently, but often still accomplish the same things. For example, people in Northern Italy eat, just as we eat in America. However, a lot of Northern Italians don't use refrigerators. Instead, they have small, efficient freezer boxes that are used to store meats. For the rest of their food, they keep it on the shelf, where they consume it in a timely manner. I've always admired this, because it leads to a couple things: people not buying in surplus, as perishable items would go bad, and people are more involved in their community through frequent, small shopping trips to the food store. This is very dissimilar to how we eat in America, where we stock a giant, energy consuming fridge with all kinds of perishables that will likely sit in their until I start to wonder "Why's the fridge smell like ass?".
<br><br>

I bring up this example to amplify her's^^^. Across the world, people do things in different manners. We should look outward to see what they do, and see if it is more or less efficient. If the answer is more, then we should try and adopt the customs. Catch me saving 500$ on a fridge, while doing my part to reduce my energy consumption, ya feel?

Hey Jessica, I really appreciated reading your comment. I'm really sorry about what happened to your parents, and it's solely due to a racist and unjust system that they were sent away. I find myself trying to appreciate where I am studying and the lifestyle I live because it could always be worse or harder, and after reading your comment I'm reminded how important it is to vote and continue to fight for human rights. That being said, I love to see that huge shift in your parents carbon emissions, albeit due to unfortunate reasons.



<br><Hr>

I agree with Jessica about how her underlying idea of how the 1% can not adjust their emissions until they are unfortunately forced to.  With her example going to a less fortunate country where emissions are less due to the living style available there.  Connection this to the first world problems about it seems hard for U.S. residents to make this adjustment but it is not because other countries have to live like this and sometimes not by choice. The U.S. can make these adjustments but they are not forced to so many do not make these adjustments.  This connects the facts of the U.S. being the top producer of emissions due to easily available factors that emit these emissions and other countries do not have access to the things we own so they can not make these emissions from the start.



<br><Hr>
Your comment reveals an interesting situation, in which a situation that would ordinarily be perceived as wholly tragic, your parents being deported to Mexico, is given a positive twist, in that they are now living an incredibly sustainable lifestyle. It is inspiring and interesting that you can see the positive in such a drastic change, but what I wonder is if your parents can appreciate that positive too. It is easy for us students to wholeheartedly recommend and admire such a lifestyle change from a distance because it is the right thing to do in theory, but I wonder if it is so easy to do and accept in practice. I wonder if there must be a trade-off between happiness and sustainability. You say your parents' new lifestyle fulfills the same necessities as their previous one, but does it afford the same amount of happiness and contentment? If it does, I am optimistic and happy for your parents. If not, I wonder if we must take a different approach to large-scale lifestyle changes.



<br><Hr>

Jessica makes a great point - we in the U.S. have the privilege to emit harmful greenhouse gases and we have the choice to fix this. As UCSB students in this climate crisis class, we have been educated on this topic like very few have. If we want to see change in the world and secure a safe and prosperous future, we need to be the change we want to see ourselves so we can inspire others to do the same and help the earth. 
<br><br>


Kalmus is a great example of this, as he himself has become the change he wants to see in the world by changing his life to become more sustainable and carbon-neutral. It is crazy how something as simple as the change from using a dryer to a clothesline can make such a big difference in one's carbon budget. Kalmus makes a great point when he outlines that personal change and collective change come hand in hand, these are both very important to occur simultaneously to help the planet. 
<br><br>

I really appreciate what Kalmus has to say that we need more than World War II force, we need all people to come together and overcome tribalism and nationalism - imaginary boundaries created in our mind that separate. Furthermore, I know some people are turned off by the meditation aspect of Kalmus' argument, but I believe meditation is one of the most important, if not the most important things we can do to come together and solve this crisis. Our "monkey mind," the ego, is very apparent to see when one sits down and meditates. After meditating and listening to one's mind, it is apparent that we actually are not thinking - thinking is happening to us. The thoughts are forms that randomly appear, often creating separation from other and the problems of our world. With meditation, I have found a heightened sense of unity with all and broken the imaginary boundaries the ego has created. Fully and deeply recognizing and understanding we are all one, we are all in this together, creates a much better space to create solutions from, and I believe meditation is key for this.

Peter Kalmus makes a good point in saying that while individual action may not be effective when we compare our actions to the actions of the rest of humanity, it is important that we remember our individual action is still making an impact.  If we only think about how our individual efforts would reduce climate change, it is easy to be discouraged because in reality we are doing nothing.  But, as Peter Kalmus states, if you are concerned with climate change, you should still do what you can to reduce your carbon footprint in order to prevent cognitive dissonance.  Doing this would allow you to live a happier life.
<br><br>
It is good that Peter Kalmus speaks about making climate conscious lifestyle changes to allow you to live a better life because it makes it easier for people to want to change their life for the climate.  Many people are not willing to make major changes because it will not make a big difference to the impact humans have on the climate.  But if you make changes in order to improve your own life, it makes more sense that you would want to make those changes.
<br><br>
After taking this course, while I was concerned with the planet before, I did not make any efforts to do anything to reduce my carbon footprint.  The decisions that I made were not made with the climate in mind.  While I was taking this class, I did see the urgency of the climate crisis, but my decisions were not really affected by what I had been learning, because I still believed that my individual efforts would not really do anything.  The fact that making decisions with the climate in mind will make me feel better because my actions are fitting with my beliefs is what will make me change the way I make decisions.

I really like what you've written about how we need to use our privilege for good instead of abusing it and forcing the consequences on the poorer countries of the world.  I think it is very important for us and others to realize how privileged we are, but it is tough for many people to realize this.  Many are under the misconception that they have worked for what they have when really the fact that they had an opportunity at all is a privilege in itself as others don't get the same opportunities.  It is also difficult to view how privileged we are since in order to see our own privilege, we need to use an outside perspective since by our own perspective, what is privileged to others may seem very normal to us.  Overall, it is important to spread awareness of how people should be appreciative of what they are given, and that we should use our privileges to help others that have not been given the same circumstances as us.  Being environmentally friendly is a very important way we can use our privilege to help others as we can (relatively) comfortably reduce our greenhouse gasses so that when greenhouse gasses are emitted, it is for something of more worth that can help others that need it.



<br><Hr>
I’m sorry to hear that your family was deported into Mexico, I can’t imagine how difficult that must be four everyone involved, the current immigration system is harsh and unruly. You made a valid point that often gets overlooked when considering our carbon footprint, and that is the limitations set by the society we live in and the infrastructure in place to promote and regulate carbon footprints. In America we don’t have an infrastructure that caters to those choosing not to use cars or airplanes as an effective mode of transportation. Geographic location as well as industries set up in locations such as Mexico can definitely reduce your overall carbon emissions inadvertently due to the limitation of technological resources available. Using machines to wash and dry clothes as well as transportation limitations factor greatly into why the US is the leading cause of carbon emissions per capita.

While not the same as your parent’s experience, I saw something in the same realm of how we wash and dry our clothes the one and only time I have left the country. My father was born in the Azores (islands off the coast of Portugal) in a small village. He is the youngest of six children and his oldest brother still lives there with his wife. When I visited Portugal a few years ago, I went to the home where my father was born and where my uncle lives with his wife, and they do not have a washer or a dryer. In fact, all around the village you can see clothes lines. There’s something beautiful about it. And it’s not like the village feels particularly old-fashioned, but it is an incredibly peaceful place, and perhaps that is in part to it being a bit lower tech.
<br><br>

I agree with you that we need to recognize our privilege. And I think as a society we can think about these types of solutions as enriching our lives, rather than detracting from them. Similar to the in the Being the Change documentary when the woman talked about the benefits of walking her children to school instead of driving them.

Hi Jessica! First, I just want to say thank you for sharing your story. Your comment stood out to me because you mentioned that your parents didn't make the choice to lead more sustainable lifestyles--they were essentially forced to do so. I think that speaks a lot to the bigger systematic issue that we have as a society, going back to the fact that not everyone has the luxury of choosing to live more sustainably. It reminds of the chapter on "collective action" where Kalmus mentioned that we need to rethink wealth and power because it's the biggest reason why we are in the current state that we are. There's only so much we (those of us privileged enough to take action) can do on an individual level. In order to truly combat climate change disaster, we need to rethink the way we function as a society and take action that will address all our social issues at the root of the problem. That being said that's why it's so important to do things like vote or going to protests--we need to use our privilege for good.



<br><Hr>
I agree about how we often use our privilege for the worst rather than for good. I loved that you mentioned your parents changing their lifestyles which turns out to be more environmentally friendly. I find it incredibly ironic how the US is considered to be the most well developed and one of the most educated countries in the world, yet we keep making the majority of the decisions that ruin our planet. We have abused our privilege and in turn this has caused the world to be where it is now. We as the 1% must use our privilege and power to make the world better not worse. We should be using our resources and technology to find new ways to fix the climate crisis rather than continuing to fuel it. If we could cause so much harm with our privilege, it is only right that we try to create that much more good by fixing our problems and establishing a better future, not just for the 1%, but for everyone across the world for generations and generations to come.

Hey thanks for this inspiring comment! I really agree with you that abig part of changing our habits and ways of living is realising who we are, or rather what we are. We are at the same time the 1% destroying the planet and because of that also the 1% that can have the most impact on the climate. We have to lead ourselves into changing, and that is a difficult tasks for people who have lived the same way for a long time. Being forced into this change (like your parents) is not something I would wish on anybody seeing as this breaches your human right imo. But change nonetheless needs to happen. We should do everything in our power to change and realise that we are impacting the planet in a drastic way. We should realise our privilege as opposed to other people that live in a  low emission way without even having the option of emitting more gasses or using the luxuries that we have. Again I was very inspired by your comment and I would say that this change in lifestyle you describe is the no 1 way in  how we can safe the planet.



<br><Hr>
Thank you for sharing a slice of your life.  
<br><br>
You're right. Different systems at play force people down different paths, in our case a capitalistic society. Whenever I talk to my parents and even my grand-parents about how their life was in Mexico, their stories are so drastically different compared to ours. And if we are comparing Carbon emissions and in general how much they affected the environment, it's pretty low. They pretty much walked everywhere. One of my abuelitos is a car mechanic so for people in the area it definitely helped locals refrain from buying a new cars often.They washed everything by hand and sun dried, in my grandmother's words she washed at "el rio", they literally would wash their clothes by the river, and one not close by. They grew up not disposing of their clothes that easily, you could hand it down to someone or upcycle it to continue wearing it. Their food was fresh, they (including extended family) either grew it or bought it from local markets who grew the food too. Someone you knew would have what you needed. Need honey? Someone harvested honey. Need Maiz? Someone grew maize. You need meat? The local butcher had you covered or a friend who would raise animals. Meat and eating out was expensive so my parents' diets consisted of home cooked meals made with fresh food, a pretty well balanced diet. Which if you think about it meant there was less of a demand for meat thus regulating the amount of domestic animals utilizing resources. Now seeing the bigger picture it's because of the type of system they were living in, they lived in pueblos not cites, where the dynamic between living on the land and by the land is different then say Mexico city where it's been “modernised" to fit this working for corporations ideal. It's the equivalent in the US of either living in the countryside vs the city. Two different narratives ya know. However, by living in a first world country we should be able to make better climate conscious decisions while also taking into consideration the positions people have in this society. That being said, being Environmentally friendly is still a privileged route.




<br><Hr>
I really understand by what you mean by thinking back to your parents. I'm really sorry to hear about your parents and hope they are doing well. I speak often about my parents in these youtube comments as they are my home and my heart. They came from a small town in Mexico before immigrating to the US and I have distinct memories of their house from when I visited when I was younger. Similar practices like the ones you talk about wee used by my family in Mexico. Airdrying, Using a small amount of water to bathe and generally clean living are a staple for me when I think of Mexico. And it is interesting that some of the methods recommended in the book to be more environmentally friendly are practices that people that do not live in US already traditionally practice. 

<br><br>

Personally, my biggest takeaway from the course definitely has to be that we can make  a difference as individual people. It is super easy to get into that "screw corporate" mindset where you believe your actions carry no wait, but I like how this class constantly pushes you to improve your lifestyle for the betterment of the environment.




<br><Hr>

I'm sorry to hear that your parents were deported, but I'm glad to see that you put a positive spin on it. It's very interesting to see that the same people can have completely different environmental impacts based on their environments and circumstances. It's because culture and lifestyle dictate how we consume things. That shows the importance of policy change, infrastructure change, and cultural change to adapt our high-consumption society to the environmental needs of today. 
<br><br>

It's also relieving to hear that two of Kalmus' three primary motivators to being a climate activist come from intrinsic goals -- aligning his actions with his principles, and the enjoyment of living with less fuel. And after seeing the Happy documentary, it's very clear that making climate-induced actions is even more beneficial on a personal level than on an environmental level. 
<br><br>

Climate change action, as you said, is a privilege in a way. Our first world problems have created a problem for the entire world, and require first world solutions to address the problem we've created.



<br><Hr>

Thank you for sharing your story, what happened to your parents and many others is a total injustice that should not be acceptable. I agree with you in that we are among the world's top polluters even though many of us pretend like we aren't. And because of that, the Global South suffers. I remember a few years ago when I visited family in Lebanon, I realized how differently they live there than I do here in America, and it was a lot more sustainable in Lebanon than it was here. That's because people in developing countries tend to consume less, waste less, and use less environmentally hazardous technologies. And despite all of that, they are the ones who will suffer the most due to the climate crisis because of the actions of the rich and of those of us in developed countries. So, I agree with you in that we have an obligation to be more conscious and sustainable in our practices and not let our privilege and greed let everyone else suffer.



<br><Hr>

Thank you for sharing the story, I'm truly sorry to hear that your parents have to go through what they experienced. Having traveled to many countries in the world - already a privilege in its own right - I have witnessed first hand how different lifestyles outside of United States contribute much less carbon footprint, while in America we definitely regard ourselves as the top 1% and think that we can get whatever we want, because there will also be supply and demand for everything; because no one is punished for wasteful behavior and usually gets away with such acts, the other parts of the world will have to suffer the consequences primarily created by us.
<br><br>

I must say that initially, I wasn't sure how this class could possibly end on a positive note, as facts presented in the first half clearly pointed to a looming catastrophe if no action is taken by our generation. After reading Kalmus' book, I was not incredibly convinced that we're yet out of the woods, but at least I feel more optimistic now. If we do our individual part of dedicating to the change, we can look forward not only to better, happier personal lives, but make a step in the right direction of saving our planet!

I agree with you Jessica, my parents were deported about 10 years ago. But the lifestyle that we had did not help out the climate crisis. My dad owned three cars all for himself since the rest of my family did not know how to drive. My mother and sister used to always go shopping at the mall and buy so much clothes. We had three walk in closets and they were filled with clothes. My parents used to buy my brother and I all the toys we wanted. Our lifestyle was not good for the planet. However when they got deported their lifestyle changed, my dad only had one car (still not good but better than three). My mom had no money so she could not go shopping anymore, we barely had enough to buy food, so we really did not waste food. The fact that people choose to live a life to help out the planet is admiral, my parents did not have a choice but now they are doing way better with their carbon footprint. This makes me admire Kevin and Peter for choosing this lifestyle because they realize that we are in a climate crisis and they are helping mitigate it.


<br><Hr>
Thank you for sharing your story, I can absolutely relate to your situation, when I was a child my father was deported and we all moved to Mexico, where we did exactly what you described your parents do. Although, I will say that I am not in total agreement with Peter Kalmus, he unlike us or my family are part of the middle class, we are not. He traveled and abused his carbon emissions that way. I on the other hand and many of my family never had the money to ever do this. Peter Kalmus has had this privilege and now he's given it up and he's happy. Now I sit here reading his chapter and he's telling me not to travel. Well thanks I never got the opportunity to anyway and now I feel like I can't. Peter Kalmus sounds like a man who has had it, I mean wealth, the ability to travel and whatever else is the dream and now he's cool with letting it go, but how does that sound for someone who hasn't had it. I still try to do my part to help with the environment and I try to educate my family on ways they could be more environmentally friendly, but there are certain things you just cannot take away. We are not on the same boat, many people in lower socioeconomic classes are not on the same boat as Peter Kalmus. There are a lot of problems I see when reading these arguments and what can be done to reduce your carbon emission. Especially being poor in the US, I mean first we have to start off with education. People from my communities don't receive the best education and education I believe is the best way to create change. Then there's also exploitation and violence and gentrification and a whole range of other things, which makes the lives of people like me and my family difficult already. My best hope is the Green New Deal so maybe some of these issues may no longer exist and we could live this peaceful happy life that Kalmus has the privilege of having.

I totally agree with you. I think peer pressure is one of the most influential factors of living like a “normal person” in America. I am an international student, and before I came to America, I have read so many things about how to “get involved” in American life. One thing that you said I can totally relate is the use of dryers. People in my country love hanging their clothes on the balcony; they feel like the sun rays could kill some of the bacteria. However, I have read so many “articles” saying that we should never hang our clothes outside because this is considering not appropriate for American people, and people will feel embarrassed about what has been done. People are considering the use of so many unnecessary things as norms, and people do not feel like that is a privilege to do so. I think we should re-consider what we really should have what we really should do in terms of saving the planet.



<br><Hr>
I totally agree that it is our responsibility as privileged college students to use our privilege for good to fight the climate crisis. I did not realize until taking this class just how many more advantages I had over other people around the world. For example, learning that only 5% of the world has ever flown shocked me because my family tends to take vacations requiring flying every 2-3 years. However, most of these advantages go hand in hand with greater contributions to the climate crisis. As you said, life in America is very different than life in a lot of other countries. In addition to our vacations, my family also contributes to the climate crisis by having two cars, one for my mom and one for my dad, when we could probably make do with one. Additionally, we have both a washer and a dryer when we could probably hand-wash clothes and hang them up to dry if we wanted. I always thought my family was energy conscious because we used LED lights, recycle, turn off lights and faucets when they're not being used, and do other common things that we are told will help combat the climate crisis. However, we have an extremely unsustainable lifestyle and if it wasn't for this class I never even would have realized it.

<br><br>

I have tried taking some steps to personally apply the lessons learned from this class. For example, I have become a vegetarian and while talking with my dad have discussed some vegetarian recipes I found that we could cook together when I visit for spring break. I hope seeing that many tasty and healthy dishes do not require meat can convince my family, if not that they should go full vegetarian, that they could at least try to cut down on the amount of meat they consume. I have also discussed with them that we should take fewer vacations, but make them longer so that we can more deeply enjoy our destination without contributing as much to the climate crisis. I hope that as time goes on I can convince them of more things that would reduce our carbon footprint. As people with a lot of privilege, it is extremely important to practice what we are being taught and do our part to stop this environmental catastrophe.



<br><Hr>

My comment won't have anything to do with the class, but I wanted to let you know how sorry I am that this happened to you. I also think you are incredibly brave and strong for continuing to be here without your parents. Getting a higher education is already hard enough with parents with you to provide support, so I am immensely impressed with you for continuing college while they were deported. Stay brave and stay strong.


<br><Hr>
Hi Jessica, thank you so much for sharing your story. After reading these chapters on how Peter and his family are able to live more sustainable lives, I realize that a lot of the changes are coming from privilege and knowledge that many of us actually have being educated at UCSB, exactly what you mentioned as well. I think we must understand that even though most Americans have more privilege and the ability to live lives of comfort, that's not always the most fulfilling life. I think that's what Peter has realized thru his work. He understands that he is in a lucky position and can affect change. Out of all the changes he has made, I think the most creative and impactful one is the car. It takes knowledge and skill to convert a diesel car to one that runs off of waste vegetable oil. Additionally, I think his vow to not fly even as a person in academia is quite the stand.
<br><br>


From the second chapter, I think the carbon fee is SUCH a good idea. All the reasons like impacting international trade, discouraging car usage, etc are so logical and valid. I would love to elect candidates that actually let this pass, because evidence seen in places like British Columbia have already proved its success.




<br><Hr>
First off, your story is really something that I think many could benefit from hearing, and I think it is really amazing you had the bravery to share it here. I myself have never had to go through what you have, but I’ve stood beside friends who have and I know it is extremely difficult. 
<br><br>

Secondly and most importantly… THANK YOU FOR FINALLY HIGHLIGHTING THAT THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS NOT JUST AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE PROBLEM, BUT A SOCIAL JUSTICE ONE TOO!!! I have been waiting for this all quarter and am glad someone FINALLY said it!
<br><br>

Everything we have learned are first world solutions to our first world problems! Like you said, whether we like it or not, UCSB is the 1%. Just the sheer fact that Peter and his wife had the CHOICE over how they live, in comparison to your parents, shows this. Their lifestyle is “inspiring” and “brings hope” to all of us, when really in almost every other place on the earth it is the norm. Goes to show how skewed our perceptions of living are as Americans. You bring up what we really should be focusing on in this course, which is “Why America Sucks: Climate Crisis Edition.”

I just wanted to start off this comment by thanking you for sharing your story with us. It is definitely not an easy experience for both you, your parents, and any one else affected by the situation. This story really humbled me as I realized I never hand washed my whole laundry before because of my access to the washing machine. They are definitely fulfilling the same necessities as the ones that I need with lower carbon emissions, even though it is unfortunate that they are being forced to do so by an extremely unjust system. I agree that these are first world solutions to first world problems. After recognizing the privilege that I have by simply living in the United States of America, I strive to change the way that I live in order to lower my carbon emission and be a part of the solution instead of the problem.



<br><Hr>
This comment was extremely powerful. As college students in the United States, we hold such overwhelming privilege in terms of the ease of our lives. Things as simple washing and drying clothes, for example. Living in the dorms can feel really difficult sometimes especially when it comes to do laundry. In the moment, it can be frustrating when all the washers and dryers are taken up. This is the embodiment of a first world problem. In America, we are privileged enough for practically everything in our lives to be done fairly expeditiously compared to other parts of the globe. But obviously, this convenience comes at a major, and selfish, price.

<br><br>

Coinciding with our fairly comfortable loves here in America, is our hefty amount of pollution we are responsible. Just like you Jessica, this piece, and this class in whole, has really made me aware of my environmental and economic privilege. As Americans, we cause so much damage to the world that all humans share solely for the purpose of making our lives slightly more pleasant. And if we aren't active in trying to counteract this damage we burden, we are nothing more than some of the most selfish humans on earth.

When I read about the clotheslines, I too thought about my own family. When I was younger, my entire family would use clotheslines to dry all our clothes, a habit brought over from their homeland, China. However, over time my parents switched to dryers and my grandparents followed suit a couple years after. By moving to America, they all gradually picked up these habits that increase their carbon footprint, and this extends to countless other aspects of their lives. For example, my family used to always hand wash and dry our dishes. Now we just use a dishwasher. It is entirely possible to live the way we did before, but people's values are different. In America, people value speed, convenience, and efficiency above everything and will do whatever it takes to attain this. There will be some sacrifices to convert to a simpler more self-reliant lifestyle, but it will be worth it in the long run. It starts with our generation, especially with all the privilege that surrounds us at UCSB.



<br><Hr>
I found your comment very interesting. I’m sorry for your current situation, but it’s a perfect example of how location has a huge impact on CO2 emissions. I noticed in Kalmus’ readings that he makes it sound so easy to switch over to such a lifestyle, and at first I was convinced. But there are cases like yours where I wouldn’t even consider it. Hard labor and a 45 minute walk? No thank you. 
<br><br>
“Even if we don’t feel like the 1%, we are. Globally, we wreak environmental havoc and let the Global South suffer because of our greed”. Putting it into a perspective like this was very eye opening. As i’m going apartment hunting for next quarter, I’m disregarding the ones without washer and dryer on site. I think of them as a necessity but it’s crazy how it’s not a necessity for everyone. As students here at UCSB, I find us very fortunate and the comparison to the 1% is a reasonable analogy.

Thank you for sharing with us the story about your parents. I have always wondered how to live without a laundry machine. I do my laundry every week and I have never hand washed my cloth. I heard from my grandparents that they used to hand wash and line dry all of their cloth. I believe even in many developing countries laundry machine is still a necessity. When it comes to environmentalism, it is not about if people can afford using a laundry machine. Instead, it is all about personal choice. Hand washing all of your stuff can be really time-consuming and boring. If the machine takes half an hour to hand wash a cloth, hand washing might take longer. On the other hand, hand washing is more gentle and many luxury brands need special care like that. So I would say the laundry machine is another form of consumerism since it makes you throw off your cloth more quickly.



<br><Hr>
Wow, appreciate that you got a bit personal here. Your anecdote adds value to the concepts that we are learning about; it adds realism and allows us to contextualize it in a way that we aren't used to seeing it. I like that you pointed out our privilege here at UCSB. I think that a lot of us, including myself at times take for granted the "endless'' recourses available to us at our disposal. I visited some rather rural parts of Mexico this past winter break and it was astonishing to see the lifestyle that the natives live. Very simplistic and technologically disengaged compared to what we here in Santa Barbara are used to. We, as students priviliged enough to take a class on climate change and the impacts of our careless lifestyles must be the ones to take what we've learned and turn it into actions that can save humanity as we know it on this earth.

Hi Jessica, thank you for sharing your story and I'm sorry your parents were deported. I agree with you that we have an immense privilege that most people in the world do not have and we are abusing it to our benefit. We cause so much damage to the environment because of our greed and the ones who take the full brunt of the consequences are the ones in 3rd world countries---people who are can't do anything about it because of how impoverished their living situation is. We should really utilize our privilege for good not the bad. Unlike people in 3rd world countries who don't have the luxury to change their lifestyles, we do. Reading Kalmus's book gave me hope that change can be made and people can turn away from environmentally-damaging practices to sustainable and green ones.



<br><Hr>
The idea that you brought up revolving around the privilege it is to be able to have the choice to make these changes is true. When I used to live at home and before I started working, my parents use to mainly buy food that fit within their budget. They didn't have the budget to buy a half gallon oat milk cartoon that cost $4.99 when they could simply buy 2 gallons of milk from Costco for the same price. Not only would it be a bang for their buck, but it would feed the whole family. However, as I left for college and my brother moved out my parents have been able to think about the food they buy more and switch to sustainable alternatives. They've switched to almond milk which is cheaper and better for the environment. The same goes for me, now that I can buy groceries for myself my food options are healthier and more sustainable. It's because I have the privilege of working and having access to local food resources that lower my costs. Even though it was difficult at first to make these changes, we do have a choice and they're not impossible. They just require adjusting to and finding a balance that works with one's current lifestyle. This is why I enjoyed when in the reading Peter addressed that our emission reductions would not look like his because everyone's life is different.

<br><Hr>
I appreciate you sharing your story because I know how hard it can be to be vulnerable on such a public platform. I agree with you in the sense that we have to realize that we are privileged and there are many people that are more unfortunate than us in the world. Often times we forget to express gratuity for the placement we are in life. My parents also immigrated here from Mexico. Growing up I was constantly reminded that the accessibility to appliances that would create a more convenient lifestyle were exponentially larger than what they were exposed to when they were my age. What I think is sad is often times as we think about the ways that our lives could be better we choose alternatives that would create a larger carbon footprint. For example my parents grew up on ranches where they would wash their clothes by hand and dry by clothes line, travel by foot or bike, and would grow their own food on their land. Now I use a washing machine, travel mostly by car or public transportation, and acquire most of my purchases at large corporations. 

<br><br>

It is extremely important to recognize that in the text "Be The Change", that Peter and his wife had the option to become more sustainable. This makes it extremely important to stress that if one is capable of leading a more sustainable lifestyle they should. We often think we are entitled to the most ornate lifestyle and that change can be pushed aside to someone further down the line. This however is not the case. I really liked that Ken mentioned that Peter Thomas brings to the table steps we can achieve in our everyday lives to create a better tomorrow for the upcoming generations.

Funnily enough, this class has really humbled me in a lot of ways. Initially, I thought I would jusy be learning more about the climate and what we can do to prevent its drastic alteration, but now I have much more knowledge on materialism, healthy diet choices, minimalism, etc. This entire class has put into perspective, not just how privileged I am, but also all the ways my privileged lifestyle has seeped into the lives of others. It truly is an eye-opening experience attending this class. I am now much more aware the monumental changes I need to make in my life that will change the way I live for the better. I do believe we are the generation capable to "Be the Change" and I think this class is a great big step for all of us together.

Yes, these are definitely problems that are being caused mainly by the first world. Developing/third-world countries are not really contributing to the climate crisis. One thing this class has taught us is that there is a huge connection between wealth and contribution to the climate crisis. Of course not all of the wealthy people heavily contribute to the climate crisis because there are those who have begun to fight against it. Also, not all of the people that live in the first world contribute a lot to the climate crisis. Poverty still exists in the first world, which is why I have a problem with you referring to all of us as part of the 1%. Maybe you didn’t exactly mean it like that, but I just wanted to make it known that even though we live in a first world country some of us are not as financially well to be making lifestyle choices that contribute heavily to the climate crisis. This is similar to what you mentioned about your parents not having much of a choice. I see that a lot in the area that I am from, but these types of areas are never mentioned in these discussions. 
 <br><br>
I’m not saying that “we”, those that do not contribute as much to climate change, should not work hard to combat climate change, but it is pretty hard to relate to some of these things and to apply some of these changes because some of these big personal things that contribute to climate change have never really been part of our lives.



<br><Hr>

I found your comment to resonate deeply with me and i totally think you are right, my biggest takeaway from this class (considering the content can be repetitive) is that we are all really truly privileged to live the lives we do here at UCSB. Yes, everybody has their personal struggles but environmentally we ARE the 1% because we just emit emit emit without a thought. It is second nature to use and though this is not financial wealth I consider it to be greater because the cost is our environment. We overspend our allotted amount of resources and others suffer.. Sure sounds like the 1% to me. Before this class and without this class I would have never thought about things like this but now my perspective is forever changed and I am so grateful.
<br><br>

Small choices like the ones given in this article are what counts because slowly then we unconditional ourselves to waste and i think this lies at the center of fixing this issue. We have all been trained to buy, consume, and throw away and this was simply not the system intended for this planet's environment. Our environment functions as a circle of life.. All matter is recycled or transformed and i think we should all strive to aid this system by being sustainable minded. We must check our privilege and go forth with mindfulness.

After reading your comment, I thought of my grandma who also lives in Mexico in a small town where technology and life itself isn't fully evolved as it is here. Last summer when I went to go visit her I also noticed that she dries her clothes outside instead of using a dryer as do many people do in small parts of Mexico. She also walks or buses with other people from her town to get to places and makes the most use of almost any clothing piece she owns because clothes are not the cheapest for them so they try to make the most of what they have. I rarely see my grandma throw away clothes, she either uses them herself, gives it away to other people, or she makes something out of it like a napkin or a scarf. I also realized that these people living in rural areas are the least privileged ones and are the ones producing fewer carbon emissions but are also the ones suffering the most from this climate crisis. Like your parents, my grandparents also didn't have the choice to be living a sustainable lifestyle. The place where they grew up and lived most of their adulthood never developed because of a lack of social movement. The Mexican president didn't care about the poor living in rural unsustainable places because all they cared about was how much money their country was producing and how the economy was flourishing with all the rich burning thousands of fossil fuel emissions. My family in Mexico was never privileged, they had to live life the hard way and adjust to a living style where conditions were bad and sometimes running water was also a shortage. This just makes me think about how grateful I am for my parents raising me here where I'm living a privileged life compared to my family back in Mexico and therefore I should keep contributing to being the change in our environment because it will help many people living in places like my family in Mexico. Like you mentioned it just seems greedy to me that many people don't care about what others go through and want everything for themselves but we shouldn't be like this, we should care for the rest of the people living in this world and for the future generation that will be extremely grateful one day that we made a change happen.

Hi Jessica, thank you for sharing your experience with this class because it gives us all a reality check.  We are the top 1% of the world even though I am a broke college student, but have an abundance of luxuries that the majority of people on this planet don't.  I think this is a more important topic than Peter and his wife making a change.  The understanding that we abuse our resources and cause so much environmental damage while the poorer nations receive none of the benefits of fossil fuels while being the groups that we are most affected by the Climate Crisis.  In the book "Be the Change '' Peter describes how lowering the amount of fossil fuels he uses on.a daily basis increases his happiness.  We must learn from this man to be happier in less destructive lives or else we are not going to have a planet to call home.  Another reason I enjoyed your comment is that I know families that have gotten deported as well and were forced into worse living arrangements.  It is insane the difference in CO2 emissions in the United States than in developing countries around the planet.  How is it fair that we are the ones getting all the benefits from destroying our climate while those not apart of global superpower are forced to suffer along with us while not being the problem?

I agree with this comment so much. My parents come from a similar background as yours. My parents are also from Mexico and whenever we visit we live such different lives. Everything is a lot more local and community focused when you travel outside of the United States I think. My parents in Mexico would walk everywhere. There was hardly any use for cars and they lived a lifestyle very similar to the one you described. One of the things that I’ve realized during this weeks reading and really this class as a whole is how wasteful we really are. But we never notice how wasteful we are becuase we’ve never known a life without all these wasteful habits. I think what this weeks reading has really taught me is to recognize these habits and weed them out overtime. Recognizing your wasteful habits is the first steps. When my parents travel to Mexico it’s like night and day. They now how to live a relatively sustainable life because they grew up in a culture that encouraged that lifestyle. But they’ve had to assimilate to to the wasteful culture here in the United States. Just something I’ve found interesting.

Thank you for sharing something so personal and with so much meaning. Simply having flown before puts people in the global elite and there are countries full of people that have a minimal carbon footprint on the world, but still suffer from the effects of climate change because of countries such as the United States which is rich and certainly has the means to produce less greenhouse gases but won't. My grandma in the states as well as the one in Taiwan do many of the same things mentioned like drying laundry in the sun. And though I do not think they do it for the environment specifically, the end result is that they are doing more for the environment than those who know of the problem but still do not change their actions. To save the environment we need to collectively stop this behavior and take action when we know something is wrong. As mentioned by many, we have the privilege to learn about the effects of climate change and the privilege to be the ones to take charge and completely change the culture so that is what we should do.

I think what makes your response so great, is that it really goes to a personal level right off the bet and makes so many of us make our own personal connections, and enhances our feelings towards what you have to say. Upon reading your reasoning as to what reminded you of your parents, struck a chord in me, as the image of my parents drying out our clothes outside since I was young, asking me to bring it in before it rains. Unlike your family, however, they were forced into this system. First world solutions to first world problems. Exactly as is stated. Both of our families face the carbon emission changes in this area, but through different pushes of means. Our family did not always do these many things that we consider steps to saving the planet and reducing our emissions, on purpose, yet they are what causes our family to use very little of everything. Our family has only myself as a child, we use electricity when we need to, AC and heat limitedly, carpool, bike, make few trips out, and so much more. And yet, it didn’t occur to me that we were making so many changes unconsciously, yet there are many others forced into these systems… You finish off powerfully, recognizing that we are the 1%. How crazy is that? We really are the 1%. And I hope we can be the 1% that decides to bring about a movement of change before it is too late.

Hey Jessica I really appreciate this comment and I'm so sorry to hear about your parents. On a global scale, we are all very privileged to live in this country and have access to many different technologies. Even the idea of being able to choose to be environmentally friendly is a privilege. Living a sustainable lifestyle is an act of recognizing your privilege. Similarly, as you were saying about school, being able to attend UCSB is something that we should all be so grateful for. So the next time any of us catch ourselves complaining about a test or complaining about finals, recognize that so many people would kill to be in the position we are in.



<br><Hr>

Jessica, I am terribly sorry that your parents got deported due to our unjust system, it is not fair, but at least we are doing our part (hopefully) in using our voice through voting to get situations like this to come to a halt. On that note, I am very interested in how your parents life changed in the blink of an eye. Not only through location, but also how they live their day to day life. I am happy that their lifestyle is so sustainable, but it does make me sad that this was because of our political system. On your point though, we actually do have a choice. We all should change our lives to live lives more like your parents. We are living in the top 1% by living in the United States and our actions are putting other people's lifestyles in harm's way. I hope that everyone is able to see the options that we have available to us that will help our planet and take after your parents.

Thank you for sharing your story and their experience! With influencers, billionaires, celebrities showing the lavish lifestyle they live, I have never truly thought of myself like the 1%. However, I have been comparing myself to the wrong people. After reading about your parent’s forced lifestyle change, I completely agree that we are the 1%. We are greedy, and it’s causing problems for everyone else around the world (but us) who can’t obtain the luxury we have so easily. My friend is an immigrant from Mexico and lives in a low income household, and his family has four cars. Even people who don't earn much money, they still have, more than other people around the world, the opportunity to buy luxurious goods. In this day and age, it would be abnormal for someone not to have a car. It’s definitely not abnormal for someone to have more than one car. But in this comment, I realize our greed because not everyone around the world has the luxury to get a car or a laundry machine or stuff in general with ease. Innocently, I thought my parents didn’t have these types of things when they lived in Vietnam because it was back then where technology was not as advanced to make things cheaper. However, that was naive of me, and obviously very much not the case. In this week’s documentary, the message revolved around consumerism culture, happiness around the world, and greenhouse gases emissions. This documentary and Kalmus shows that you can be happy and live a pleasant lifestyle without developing a fat climate footprint.

Thank you for sharing your story. I really appreciate the way you parents live now.About the dryer, I also want to tell you something about my hometown. I am from China. From what I know is that most of Chinese family do not have dryers in their home. And they take the way you parents now take to dry their clothes. This is the fact that I find really lucky and great since China has a large population, if every family uses a dryer, that would cause a huge pollution. So it is lucky for my family to not use a dryer. Well, I noticed that almost there is a dryer in every house in the US, which I find astonishing. Although it is convenient, but it would cause so much pollution. So I would hope everyone choose a green way to dry their clothes in the future. And you are true, we are lucky to be the one in UCSB who are able to learn about climate change. So at least we can make our efforts to age this planet better.

Hi Jessica thank you for sharing your story. It really puts into perspective how here in the united states we take for granted all the unnecessary commodities we have. Our incessant greed and laziness is a cultural problem, which now the planet is paying for. I think its admirable of Peter Kalmus to have cut his carbon emissions by a factor of 10 because there’s no better way to advocate change than to practice what you preach. I like how you mentioned we have to recognize our privilege as students at UCSB, even though we don't feel like the 1%. We’ve learned so much about climate change and sustainability, so, like you said, we can't be complicit. “When I feel unsure about whether or not I should speak out, I think of the billions of people with no voice on the matter. I think of those who are most vulnerable. I think of my children. And then the decision to speak out is easy.”




<br><Hr>
I want to highlight that there is a difference between using privilege for good and not using privilege for all. A lot of people, particularly you, seem to use the word privilege as a catch all for any situation in which those with are placed on a pedestal above those without. That is not the case here. A very key part to understanding the climate crisis is understanding the concept of privilege, but what you are describing is not actually a situation where privilege exists. What you are describing is a situation where people are not willing to give up what they have and people without find it a lot easier to use less and be more efficient. 
 <br><br>
Recognizing our privilege, in this specific instance, means taking the time to really understand that we are better off with less. But without a clear distinction, recognizing our privilege could also mean that we take full advantage of all of the carbon-unfriendly accoutrements that pattern our life and lifestyle. 
 <br><br>
Privileged or not, we all need to learn how to live better with less. This is something that people rich and poor will struggle with, and this is exactly why climate change will be such a global issue.



<br><Hr>
I am living in IV next year, and, because of this reading, I have made it my mission to convince all of my 7 roomates that the dryer is an unecessary compononet of the house, not only because it produces so many emissions, but also because it is much cheaper to use a clothesline. While it is a small change, 8 college students refusing to use a dryer would probably have double the impact that Peter Kalmus' refusal to use the dryer had, resulting in a substantial enough decrease in overall carbon emissions. Furthermore, it is not a radical lifestyle change, and it is something that all of my friends can easily get behind, for one reason or the other.




<br><Hr>
Hi Jessica, I appreciate your sharing of your personal stories. I agree with you saying we are the 1%. We are all living under privileges unconsciously. However, we should have a clearer recognition of our standpoint, thus we will make good use of our privileges. Your personal story remind me of one of my own stories. Once I travelled to a remote area in China with less-developed economy. Almost all the families there wash their clothes with hands. There are no such things like dryer, smart phones, computers, electronic cars...They have limited choices, but they are living a way more environmental-friendly compares to us. We truly are enjoying all the advantages from the society's developments, but we are polluting our planet in a disastrous way which we don't intend to do. Choices vs lifestyles, this has been a problem. 
<br><br>
The reading materials are shocking. The author introduced his personal ways to cutdown emissions in various ways, with his family together. The efforts he undertake are admirable. If he can do it, we all can. We need to recognize the problem at the first point, and then take actual actions to make it better, instead of worsening it. I have been brainwashed after reading the two chapters and I feel myself capable to save the planet in my way if I make changes to my life. And I sincerely hope everyone has reached the same mindset transition.




<br><Hr>
I can't agree more with this comment. I could rephrase it but it'd almost be a waste of breath. It's up to us to reduce our emissions, because we are the ones that can: other people may not have the choice to use a dryer or not, some people can't use a car because it costs too much, but we are in a relatively small group of people that 1) pollutes far more than almost any other group and 2) has the ability to pollute far less. It is up to us to make these choices, and there is simply no escaping it. 
<br><br>

It really is insane just how much we pollute, and how much America is set up to pollute as vastly and fully as possible. We have to drive to get nearly anywhere outside of a city (and even many places within one); we import foods from all over the world and waste a vast majority of it; we use planes because our trains suck, we use cars for the same reason; our cities are sprawling and the opposite of dense, making sure we have to consume as much gas as physically possible to get anywhere. It's honestly atrocious, but even then we really do have a choice. We can eat less meat, we can drive less, we can figure out a way to be better. Political activism is of course the best way to restructure our cities, but-- as much as I hate to admit it-- supply and demand do matter, too. We can help with every little bit.



<br><Hr>
I agree, I feel like the focus of this class is that the people that are hurting the environment via emissions are the people most able to actually do something about it. From eating less meat to living in smaller houses, people that are more well off will be the ones eating more meat, living in larger houses, and buying more cars, and using more fossil fuels in their daily life. Throughout these videos, the main thing has been to own less and use less. I understand now how the climate crisis can be solved most easily through culture change. Our destructive behavior stems from the capitalist society that we live in where bigger is always better and companies want us to buy more and more. But we don't realize that buying more and owning more stuff puts in more emissions. The simplest way to curb our emissions is to live by spending less on basically everything. That way, the things we own and use aren't excessively big or wasteful and helps fight against climate change.





<br><Hr>
I really enjoyed reading your comment! Although I do not have the same experience as you, reading about your experience was both interesting and eyeopening. The change in your parent's lifestyles was certainly drastic. But your comment about necessities still being met, but just in a different way, really struck me. Yes, the luxury of having two cars, a washing machine, and a dryer is great. But the old school ways, before technology brought these inventions, hand washing and hang drying were the only options, and it got the job done albeit less efficiently.
<br><br>


I agree with you about your statement about privilege. I am living in one of the wealthiest countries, healthy, and pursuing higher education. I have luxuries that I don't even think about, that someone has never ever experienced and may never be able to. As Americans, we have many privileges that those in developing countries do not. Yet with this privilege we are not using it for justice but only enjoying them greedily. Our greed will hurt not only us but also countries that have little carbon emission that do not deserve it. As a big and wealthy nation we have the duty to care for those who are less fortunate.






<br><Hr>

Your story is incredibly humbling for many of us that forget what it's like for others in less fortunate positions as us. I am thankful for you sharing this personal story with us as it allowed us to view this topic in a different perspective. As you said, it's hard to imagine that we are in the 1% that have the ability to become educated and are given the opportunity to choose to be sustainable. It's frightening to think that the majority of others in our shoes use this privilege for their own self-benefit and greed. If there's one thing we can do to tackle climate change, it would be to convince these people that they need to take action for the greater good not just themselves. We have a privilege that many others do not and so we should use it wisely, and never forget that we have this privilege when others don't. It's important to stay humble and to try and make the world a better place for everyone, not just ourselves. The movie's impact seems way less in comparison to your story about your parents. I think if people were to hear about how others are forced to lower their carbon emissions while we have the choice to, it would put things into perspective for many other people. We have such a large impact on other people who aren't even contributing much to the global climate change that we need to focus on helping the rest of the people who don't have a choice. Again, I'm truly sorry to hear about your parents being deported, I hope you are well, especially in these crazy times. Thanks for sharing your story.

Privilege is the unearned advantage that one group has over another. Climate change and the concept of privilege are inextricably linked.
<br><br>

We emit 25% of global greenhouse gas emissions, yet we are only 4% of the population. It's a privilege to be able to deal with the consequences of climate change. It's a privilege to even learn about this issue and implement changes into our lifestyles. Many people, like my parents, don't have that choice.
<br><br>

I think you may have misread my comment. My comment was meant to highlight that we have to use our privilege to clean up our mess rather than live carbon addicted lifestyles.
<br><br>


Also, you are right that both rich and poor will deal with the consequences, but to EXTREMELY different degrees. Not all countries have adequate resources to deal with natural disasters that will come as a result of climate change. Ken mentioned before how he was lucky to have been safe during the Thomas fire, if he was anywhere else in the world he likely would have lost his home. Don't turn a blind eye to the developing world. There are billions of people who won't survive food shortages, flooding, etc.



<br><Hr>

Your comment really caught my eye as you shared a personal story that I found so intriguing. After hearing your story, I am completely aware of how privileged I am and you are right, we do have the choice to switch to a sustainable lifestyle so why don't we! People who are forced to live a sustainable lifestyle are the ones who are affected by climate change the most. So those who are privileged should do the least they can do and live in sustainable ways, however, our society is so obsessed with luxuries that they think its nearly "impossible". Something that has especially caught my eye in the article "Leaving Fossil Fuel" was one of the reasons why he reduced in the first place. The reason he reduced is that he is aligning his actions with his principles. This was the most interesting reason to me as to why one would reduce because in my eyes it makes the most sense. As one who knows and feels guilt about my carbon emissions and is reducing this reduced our cognitive dissonance which is something I truly believe. So not only do we as UCSB students have the privilege that other people don't have, such as your parents, we also can relieve some guilt by doing the right thing instead of ignoring it.




<br><Hr>
Thanks for sharing your story Jessica, and I am sorry that your parents have to go through these. When you said that Peter had a choice not to use a dryer, whereas your parents didn't have such a choice, it reminded me how developed countries are responsible for a majority portion of greenhouse gas emissions, and how developing countries only contribute a little per capita, but people there have to suffer more from the environmental consequences. It's sad, and I 100% agree with you that we should be aware of our privileges. My grandpa never wastes any food. He is always the one that finishes the rest of our plates, even if he feels full. My mother and I sometimes scoff at him about it. Now I realize it is because he's been through the days when famine was widespread, and a single food stamp was precious enough for a family. We are the lucky ones because we don’t have to go through these horrible experiences, but it's unfair that we use our privileges to live better lives while others can't but suffer from the worsening environment. It could have been any of us. It could be the next generation who would all suffer from these if we don’t act now.

I enjoyed reading this week's chapters. These articles told me that simple things can make big changes-- I started eating less meat, and I try to fly less and to drive an electric car. In the future, I am going to take more action to reduce my carbon footprint on the environment.
<br><br>
I agree with the proposal to set a carbon fee and the dividend is valid. However, in current society, money is the only incentive that will make this proposal work.

While watching the movie, I was thinking the same thing you said, this family seems to live a full life, and it's sustainable. To me, the family was in their own world, as happy as they were in their own little community. Their lifestyle changes seem simple and easy, such as cycling around, growing their own produce, and giving free food to their neighbors. This really gave me hope, because my father mentioned that even with this mindset and making small changes, your lifestyle will eventually go a long way, but over time. I was surprised when he said it took him four years to reduce emissions by more than 10 times that amount, because it seemed too long. However, their current lifestyle greatly compensates for this. I still can't help but think of all the "what if". As you mentioned, I immediately thought of my own family and how difficult this lifestyle was for them. My parents sometimes had to travel long distances to pay the bills and allow me to come here. In addition, the family of my closest friend had to clean up various parts of the town, which made things like riding a bike unreasonable. Still, there are plenty of alternatives to using a bike, and my family certainly can. As mentioned in the movie, what needs to be done is to get more people involved in sustainable development to witness large-scale change.

Thank you for sharing your story. It is such a sad reality that we are truly the one percent that you mentioned in your comment. We are so lucky that we are learning about the different ways and the consequences for the actions that people brought upon our environment. One's actions that would help the planet can make a huge difference. And from your comment I realized that people must come together to understand each other in order for this to happen.




<br><Hr>


I strongly agree with your idea about how we as UCSB student are privileged and that we should use our privilege for good. I also like your example of your parents’ example, as this is a true side of our society and such examples really encourage the more privileged students like me to do something for better life of the others, such as a better education, living standards, and the resources for them to maximize their potential. I truly agree that there are a lot of people in the world who don’t have access to resources they can use to maximize their potential. They are likely to be limited by things like financial constraints. However, there are also some other people who do have access to abundant resources but don’t treasure them and don’t use them to improve their knowledge and skills. This is probably a social problem, and I am still learning to try to see a clearer picture of the problem.  
 <br><br>

Besides my reflection on different lifestyles as a social issue, I also see that this week’s reading further elaborates on last week’s film, which provides us a more concrete and detailed picture of Peter’s changes of lifestyle and the impacts associated with those changes. As Ken emphasized in the video lecture, these changes are remarkable, and it is easy to imagine how big an impact would that be if people around the world can follow these changes. However, I also agree that these are first world solutions to first world problems, but these solutions are still very powerful since the biggest emitter (on an individual or consumer level) are mostly not from the poor people but from the rich people in the first world. So, start changing ourselves now, and changes in the world will start to happen.

Thank you for sharing your story and I agree with you. We as American do abuse all our luxuries and don't even notice it. My mother likes to air dry most of her clothes while I put my clothes in the dryer and look at her like she is crazy. Most families in American all have a car for each family member as well. Most Americans would  rather take the easy route and emit mire carbon rather than do a little extra step to help the planet out a bit. Let's face it us Americans have a lot of privilege when it comes to materialistic things we don't really need.

Hi Jessica, thank you for sharing your story and showing how so many aspects of our lives can be related to this topic. As students in the United States, we have an immense amount of privilege compared to other parts of the world in regards to having access to resources, manufactured goods, and basic necessities. Throughout the class, we have learned about many ways that mostly educated, upper-middle class families in the United States have made changes to their everyday lives to become sustainable. However, the reality is that many people have had to live without the luxury of a car or simple home appliances given their economic circumstances and lack of access to such necessities in the first place. 
<br><br>
When viewing environmental injustice as a whole, I believe it's important that we do our best for the greater good of our community. As you mentioned, we must use our privilege for good. Those of us with access to manufactured goods and appliances should do our part to reduce our usage and make changes in our diets and lifestyles. While not all of the recommended changes may be possible to make at once, we should all strive to work towards creating a society that benefits all of its members.

Thank you for sharing your experience, I really appreciate this comment. I think a lot of us fail to realize that we have the privilege of having a choice. Many people live very environmentally friendly lifestyles not because they chose to, but because they have to. I agree with you when you say that even if it doesn't feel like it, we are the 1%. I think we need to do a better job recognizing the privilege we have, and how it affects others. Life in America is so consumer and profit driven it is insane. That being said, it is our job to change our lifestyles.




<br><Hr>
Thank you for sharing your story. First of all, it is very unfortunate to see your parents being deported to Mexico. I am glad if they are doing well over there. It is also interesting to observe how their lifestyle have changed when their place of living changed. I have encountered similar experiences when I entered UCSB three year ago. I have never used any dryer before coming to U.S (I did not know they existed) because I dry my clothings under the sun for my entire life. This is just one little example of how carbon footprints are different among people living in different regions. And this is why I never felt privileged until the moment I entered UCSB. Now as I gradually adapt to the "first world countries" lifestyle, I felt it is too “over" compared to lifestyles of my parents and grandparents. In other words, it is our generation that can be the change.





<br><Hr>


Thanks for sharing your parents’ story. I personally could resonate with such a changing lifestyle. My experience is somehow reversed to your parents’. In my home country-- China, a majority of households don’t use drying machines or dish-cleaning machines. Though we don’t take it as a disadvantage, I found it really a lifestyle change for me to study abroad here in the U.S and California in particular. My carbon footprint has definitely gone up since I was here. Partly because of these everyday household appliances that I am using. Major changes are in terms of diet change and ways of communicating. Pork is the main meat that Chinese people consume on a daily basis, unlike beef in the U.S which could contribute to significantly more carbon emission. And back to China, I used to commute walking or riding buses, while here in the U.S riding buses or walking is greatly reduced partly because of the less-concentrated city planing. Nevertheless, I am not trying to condemn such thing as “first world lifestyle”, instead what I am trying to say is that it is possible to live with reducing carbon emission. As you said, what we’ve been studying for this course are mainly “first-world solutions to the first-world scenario.” It really brings me back to Leonard’s conversation with an Indian Government official, who said it would be impossible for countries like Indian to comply with the solutions provided by the most developed nations in the world while a great number of its citizens are still starving to death. This is really a problem that worth consideration, are these solutions following a post-colonializing ideology or are they just feasible anywhere around the globe.

I with a heavy heart felt what you said and the connection you made of actual living lifestyles to carbon footprints is very unique. Living here for so long in the United States I forget how privilege I am, even if it doesn't feel like it sometimes but compared to where I come from in Guatemala I am living the dream. I often talk to family members back in Guatemala and I am reminded of the luxury that I live in. Here in the United States I may not have the biggest house or the newest car, or live in the best neighborhood but I do have electricity, running water and a drainage system. These are luxuries that many people from places like where I was born do not have. This in correlation to carbon emissions, families such swine in Guatemala have such a small carbon footprint yet they suffer first hand from the effects of it. For example, in the country of Guatemala there are a lot of banana plantations but now many are losing their harvest because there isn't as much rain anymore and its getting warmer every year. These are direct effects of climate change, but yet they aren't the big contributors to carbon emissions. This personally makes me very frustrated because it so unfair how people/places have to suffer the consequences of arrogant nations who don't care about how they are affecting the climate because they haven't severely felt the changes themselves.

Wow, I really like your comment because (1) you shared a really personal story about your family that many of us, POC students, can relate to and (2) you're utterly and completely right. It might not seem like we fall into that 1% category but we're actually way more privileged than many other people around the world. We tend to not realize how privileged we are to have a roof over our head, clothes on our back, an education, and much more. I remember when I was younger, I was jealous that my family sent a laptop to one of my cousin's in Mexico before getting me one. Now that I'm older and more knowledgeable, I realize how selfish that was of me. Compared to the US, people living in Mexico and other countries around the world are struggling to get by every single day and here we are complaining about the little things in life- like our food being made incorrectly or our electronic devices malfunctioning. 
<br><br>
Another thing I found interesting was how each dollar we spend represents 1/2 a kg of CO2 emissions. Hearing that the average American spends $6,000 a year and putting into perspective how much CO2 emissions that accounts for is appalling. This reading and Ken's lecture video has made me become more frugal and picky on what I choose to spend my money on. I can only imagine how much CO2 emissions I contributed alone with the laptop I'm using to type this comment up. We all have to work towards switching to a more eco-friendly lifestyle and using our privilege to help others rather than being selfish.

I agree what you said, Jessica Mora. As human, we have already controlled and destroyed the whole world by our voracity. When my parents were little kids, their did not have enough money to purchase car or even did not know about it. However, they could still live in their happiness. In this way, I think greedy is the main key of environmental problem. Also, I agree with what you said about the situation of environment.

Thank you for sharing your parents’ experience, I’m so sorry this happened. I agree with the observations you made regarding how their carbon emissions have drastically changed and how we take advantage of our privilege being UCSB students. I have seen in my Latinx communities back home that we don’t really waste food, it's common to air-dry clothes, and we often don’t have a choice but to live a minimalist lifestyle. We might not feel like we are in the 1% especially when many of us struggle with food insecurity or other financial problems, but the very fact that we are able to receive a higher education is an enormous privilege in itself. I also think that we are also faced with new problems we might not have seen before. We are in the process of gaining the tools and knowledge to make much more significant changes in addition to the personal actions we can make now. We have to make the most of our access to knowledge and power we have as college students and future professionals.

Like yourself, I have also personally witnessed the cultural differences between countries. When I was younger, I would visit Mexico and think of how different it was there because of the lack of technologies that they could not afford. For example, most people did not have a washing machine or dryer as you mentioned. However, that is the norm there and people did not look down on others for it. This is why I do recognize and see how we are privileged to live in a more affluent country. It is us that are contributing to climate change the most while there are people in other countries that have no other choice but to live sustainably yet will suffer the most from the climate change consequences. We need to end the stigma around living a simple life. It is unfair that people who do not even get a say nor enjoy the luxuries that are being taken advantage of will be adversely affected. Therefore, we need to recognize our privilege and act unselfishly by changing our lifestyle to a more environmentally friendly one.

After reading the text and also reading your comment, I wanted to first sharing your personal story with us. I completely agree with you when you say that we wreak havoc and let the rest of the world suffer. We really are the 1% even if we don't feel like it. We have so many resources available to us that we take for granted. Other people would give anything to have things that we see as simple like a washing machine. We use our privilege and benefits in the wrong way and use it to destroy the world with no careless. We need to start taking action in combatting the climate crisis and stop tag advantage of our may resources available here in the US. We must make the switch to a simpler lifestyle little by little.

"Being the Change" by Peter Kalmus definitely did shift my ideas on how personal action can help the climate crisis. I found the readings to be much more easy to digest than the films, as the kitchy meditation scene and his cringeworthy tattoo detracted from his credibility as a fellow citizen attempting to help mitigate the climate crisis. The readings were much easier to understand and accept. One thing that he mentioned that really resonated with me was how personal action can begin to shift culture by other people witnessing change, and I do think this is important, because I for one know that I often feel disheartened by our current situation. If I were able to see more positive change, I know that myself and others would feel more inclined to make change in our lives, which would then create more change and actually create a positive feedback loop of change. While some ideas such as human composting, I don't see the average person adopting, but maybe other ideas that are convenient or cost effective could begin to be adopted. Kalmus also discussed how a large amount of emissions are caused via waste, such as leaving lights on, natural gas leaking, and food and material waste. With many smart technologies being developed such as smart houses, I believe a large amount of this waste will be cut out, not even with the environment in mind, but rather to save money for users of this smart technology.

I agree that this reading by Kalmus was way easier to digest than the documentary. With this reading, we are given ways we can help the environment in our daily lives. Things like riding our bikes instead of driving and controlling our waste. I disagree with you on the point that technology can help control our waste. Why yes I believe it could, I think we are all capable of doing that ourselves. It comes down to simple things like eat all your food or be aware how much you order and don't get too much because you can always just get more. I think that we must also challenge our mindsets when it comes to making small changes too. Instead of it seeming like a chore, we have to make it seem like a challenge. How much can we limit our footprint, I think Kalmus talked about it even being a sort of game to him, so why can't we. Riding your bike does not have to be a drag, instead it can be nice to enjoy the breeze and the nature around. By changing your attitude, changing your habits becomes an after thought and not a chore at all. If others not only see you being a part of the change, but enjoying it like Peter mentioned, it will help spur the "collective action."

Hey Jack, I think you make a good point about climate actions creating a positive feedback loop. This is something that both Peter and Ken talk about, one must convince people with their actions. Part of what makes Ken’s class so convincing is that he himself follows an environmentally friendly lifestyle. If we want people to understand the necessities of lifestyle change, then we ourselves need to do it first. This, in my opinion, is Peter’s main goal in both the film and the book, to convince people by doing. I think the movie was pretty great and I actually quite enjoyed the meditation scene, but I do agree the reading was easier to follow. The reading had a lot of shocking facts that really caught me off guard. Peter leads with the fact that an average US citizen waste causes 1.3 metric tons of emissions per year. That's more than the total impact an average citizen from Bangladesh has. In addition, we spend over 6000$ a year on stuff, accumulating 3 metric tons of carbon emissions. These facts show just how consumer-oriented our country is, and how the planet pays the price for it. One other thing I enjoyed about the film was the focus on what impact each change had on Peter’s emissions. Peter points out like quitting planes and switching to biking and then explains exactly why and how they decreased his carbon footprint. In addition, he shows that he can maintain a fulfilling, easygoing lifestyle. Often people feel like adopting an environmentalist lifestyle will require huge sacrifices, Peter shows that this is rarely the case. For example, he explains that becoming a vegetarian and then soon after a freegan cut his carbon emissions by 2,500kg per year. He also noted that eating as a freegan was satisfying and not a stretch for most people. Lastly, I agree with you that technology can play a huge role in the future at reducing accidental waste and cutting carbon emissions. However, I don’t think that’s enough, we also need activism and legislation that forces people to think about the carbon they use. Peter’s book and film alike do a great job of conveying that to the individual, but ultimately without laws and a firm structure to lay down the ground rules of carbon use, people will never make the effort to cut carbon until it's too late.

Environmentalism is a state of mind. I agree with you that the problems we face today can be disheartening as there is inevitable environmental changes happening all around us. It’s also hard to be the one who changes as social perception puts pressure on the need to succeed in order for others to follow. Peter Kalmus discusses with us the things we can do to reduce carbon emissions through his personal, relative results of his own actions of change.This week’s readings especially Chapter 14 focuses on specific solutions that should be implemented into society such as the Carbon fee & dividend which entails setting fees on emissions so that less people will be motivated to overproduce carbon. There was a quote that really stood out to me in this reading, "Daily life is a series of choices". Overall, it comes down to when someone even oneself decides to finally take the first step in trying to change as without a beginning there cannot be a solution. Technology might be able to cut waste out, but I personally think that it is more of our decisions that influences how much waste we produce. For instance, solar panels help generate energy through sunlight which is a better form of reducing carbon emissions but if one leaves the light on all night long there is bound to still be negative impacts if electricity is used in excess.

I fully agree with this comment. First of all I agree that the readings were much easier to understand and way less distracted than the movie. Also, it really makes sense that what we do can influence others. I often wondered what difference we were making when we made changes in our individual lives; it felt like it really didn’t make a dent. I questioned what difference it would make if I went vegan, if it is only the minority of people that are practicing a plant-based diet, I always figured that my impact was negligible. I’m sure that many other people have thought of this as well. However, when we see people in highly influential positions follow a trend, so many people are influenced to do it as well. Imagine how great it would be if most celebrities actually practiced what they preached when it comes to environmentalism. Even though we aren’t in positions of power as great as celebrities, we can make small differences by influencing friends and families who can then influence others that they are connected to and slowly make a larger effect. Even with practices like human composting, which is a little less attractive and definitely not for everyone, someone who knows about it but doesn’t do it themselves can talk about it and the idea may be introduced to someone who is into it and tries it. I definitely see now that it really doesn’t hurt to be more environmentally friendly and can actually be more influential than I thought!





<br><hr>
I totally agree with you! Reading the book chapters actually helped me understand the numbers behind the greenhouse emissions we produce and put into context how much we can and should cut down to drastically lower our carbon footprint. Whereas on the other hand, when I was watching the film, I would always find my self distracted from the message he was trying to convey because of his "strange" personality and lifestyle choices. If anything, the film seems to hurt its cause more than doing any good for it. Now with the readings, I feel like this is the perfect resource to give to those who are interested in finding ways to help the environment as it provides a factual, comprehensive list of all the the strategies you need in order to succeed! As mentioned before, of course it would be very hard for someone to implement every strategy on the list, but by at least taking small baby steps such as reducing the amount of meat consumption and increasing the your use of public transportation will make a world of difference in the long run.

I really resonated with your opinions regarding the book in comparison to the film. While watching the documentary last week, I often found myself struggling to focus on the core information due to the way it was produced, but the readings were much more straightforward and easy to follow. That being said, although the film highlighted important lifestyle changes people can make to reduce their climate footprint, the readings this week were helpful in visualizing the steps we can take to achieve the same goal. 
<br><br>

Like you said, there are many changes we can make to our lives that aren’t nearly as “extreme” as those presented in the film. While baby steps are not as quick as huge lifestyle shifts, they are definitely influential in combating the climate crisis. In the long run, it seems much more effective to have everyone making moderate efforts to reduce their personal climate footprint than to have a few people drastically change their lives to help the environment. This chain reaction you alluded to in your comment will not stem from a small number of people making huge lifestyle changes, but rather from a movement within the general public to do better. Once we can adopt a more eco-friendly mindset, it will be much easier to get people on board with bigger changes to daily life.

I completely agree with you on your comparison between the film and the reading. While watching the film, I found a lot of the stuff he did kind of cringey and laughable in a way. I felt bad laughing about it because I knew he was a hardcore climate activist and is helping the planet, but many of the things they described him doing made him seem more like a radical and took away from his actual message. 
<br><br>
However, when I got to the reading I completely changed my opinion on Peter. It was a concise and to the point message about what we as individuals should do, as you mentioned the positive feedback loop. But also what has and hasn't worked in the government. I really enjoyed his in depth descriptions of cap and trade and the carbon tax and which one actually worked. Before this reading, I understood what both were to an extent and had heard the terms throughout the course, but many of the articles we have read failed to go into what specifically we have to do and which one is better. Like you, I really enjoyed the "Tipping point"  section of the reading. It changed my view on what it means to be a climate activist. Beforehand, I believed that individual action such as riding the bus was sufficient for one person helping the climate change initiative. But his description on that positive feedback loop really puts into perspective how having a voice can shift social views as a whole.

It was interesting to see how much better it was to read rather than watch what Kalmus actually had to say. I felt the movie was kind of boring, and although it was cool to see it in action, it didn't settle as well as the reading did for me. I agree with you on how much easier it was to understand be more accepting to his ideas. I felt that if we had read the chapters before watching the movie, it would have made me more receptive to his choices and how he chose to go about it in the film. Nevertheless, his actions to mitigate this climate footprint were actually pretty cool. Although he did turn his life around, it didn't take a lot of money and he actually benefited from it both physically and mentally. Even the smaller things he did, like riding your bike, are easy changes that can be implemented into your daily life instead of persay a driving a car that relies on cooking oil or building a restroom in your backyard. This reading was different in the fact that he not only implemented these changes into his daily life, but he also talked about how it changed his mental health for the better. Most climate related films and readings are usually dark and dreary and based heavily on statistics– Kalmus just talked about how meditating made him happier. It was uplifting to see a change, and although he knows he can't save the entire world, he does it in the belief that he can and I think that is an attitude we all need to adopt. He expresses how, "small actions lead to bigger ones" and it is extremely right. If we were able to see these changes in front of us like you said, then we will see change happening quicker and at a larger rate because we can physically see how it changes us and our environment.

I definitely agree with your comment. I too, really liked that “Being the Change” seemed more normal than the film. I found the film a little hard to grasp, whereas the readings were much more realistic and applicable. I really liked that he brought up vegetarianism, as I try my best to be a vegetarian. It was shocking to hear that only 3% of Americans are vegetarian, but it can singlehandedly reduce emissions by 1,500 kilograms of CO2. It was encouraging to hear that small and relatively easy changes can make a big difference. I still think the idea of freeganism is a little hard to support though. While I recognize that it helps the environment and reduces waste, it brings up some health concerns. 
 <br><br>

I think the most interesting part of the reading was when he discussed the carbon fee. Even though we have discussed this many times in class, I always left feeling that it wasn’t realistic or achievable. After reading his perspective on it, my view completely changed. He laid it out in detail, explaining not only what would happen domestically, but abroad as well. He discussed how it has worked before and even offered alternative solutions. The idea of a carbon fee completely clicked for me and I am excited to go home and educate my family about it. I thought overall this reading was very comprehensive and wasn’t too far-fetched. It was practical, packed with facts, and easy to understand. I strongly believe that if more people read more about climate change, they would be informed and on board.



<br><hr>

I agree with your focus on how seeing a change occur is more likely to have others to adopt this change as a part of their lifestyle as well. In class, we mentioned that places such as Burger King witness that change and shift among people and adapt. Our personal level actions can affect the bigger companies because they will do almost anything to get our money even if it means selling plant-based items or switching over to renewable energy sales rather than fossil fuel. I believe that our choices in life will affect the people around us and soon cause bigger companies to be unable to avoid changing for the better. However, this process alone would be way too slow for how bad of a situation our planet is in at the moment so we need to vote for better policies as well as people to enact those policies. You mention that you don’t see human composting as something that will be adopted but I feel as though anything that was mentioned in “Being the Change” could be enacted if we got people to feel less stigmas about them. For example, freeganism may look disgusting to some people because why would anyone want “old” or “bad” food. We have this stigma that anything that is thrown out of the store must be bad and thus trash but often times items are tossed for being not as pretty or have a beat-up box. At most Albertson’s, they have a corner of the store where they put all the dinged up items or close to expiring on sale for 50% - 75% off. I often look at this corner specifically because they have baked good over there. When the baked goods hit their sell-by date they are thrown to the corner and sold for $2 or $3 but are just as good as the others with maybe some stale or dry pieces. I think if all stores were to have corners like this and then donate the leftovers that are not taken to homeless shelters, we would be doing a great deed to feed all of our people while lowering our waste levels. But stores won’t know if we want things like this unless we tell them and make efforts to use them when they are available.

The part where he mentions personal reduction can shift the culture and therefore help with reducing the greenhouse gas emission also resonates with me because it encourages me to take actions and stop thinking about what if my effort wouldn't be enough to help reducing the global greenhouse emission. If I divide the amount of greenhouse gas that I reduced by the global population, of course it would be trivial. But if I think of it as affecting the people around me thus make them reducing their emission as well, I can see my actions having a much bigger impact on the environment. I also love the fact that me mentions several accessible methods to reduce the greenhouse gas emission instead of suggesting using solar panels or other methods that I couldn't accomplish by myself.

I totally agree with your comment. When I watched the movie “Being the Change” I was not interested and honestly very bored at a lot of points. In my opinion, the documentary was not filmed in the most engaging and strong way, but reading “Being the Change” was a lot more interesting to me. I found that the personal actions that Peter explained made a lot more sense while reading it. As you said, this reading really shifted my ideas about how important personal action can be even if it is just one individual or one family. Although Peter did not force his friends to switch their actions, he indirectly showed them and us (as his audience) how important taking on these personal actions is. By taking on these personal actions, we can all change the “stigma” that is based upon how personal action will never truly make a change. The reading really opened my eyes to the big impact personal action creates in the long and short run. I thought it was interesting how Peter’s biggest contributor to carbon emissions was flying when most people in the world never fly. I think with the flying phenomenon something that Peter mentioned in the chapter titled “Leaving Fossil Fuel” was very important, which was that many Americans especially believe that they have no choice other than to fly because of their job or because they are trying to change the world. I think that what Ken has done by fighting the large issue of flying with creating more spaces online to communicate for work purposes is extremely important and that it has to spread by us and the people who know about it as of right now telling the people we know about the horrible impacts of flying. By living a suburban lifestyle with a family including 2 children, Peter proves to us that we can make personal changes and still continue living normal lifestyles. He has truly changed his emissions by changing his lifestyle through stopping to fly, becoming vegetarian, consuming less, biking, and leading this movement of personal change and its impacts. Peter doesn’t even use any smart technology, which would make switching to a more sustainable lifestyle even easier, because of the cost. But even this sustainable and smart technology is becoming more affordable now, which is great news.




<br><hr>
I completely agree, while reading these two chapters, it was a lot easier to take it and understand the actual steps to take towards bettering our environment. I do agree that he mentions a multitude of ideas that would require a major shift in culture which I do not think is possible in such a short time such as human composting. But I do agree with all the small steps that are easy for anyone to take like biking more or most importantly limiting our waste. I think overall the biggest thing we can do, which Kalmus talks about, is not wasting as much whether it's clothes or food. And while a common misconception is that in fixing the climate crisis, that we fall back on all of our technological advancements, I believe that we can reverse that idea. Like you mentioned, with more smart technologies we can help eliminate waste in the environment. Overall if we start shifting jobs towards manufacturing more eco-friendly products instead of products with large carbon emission, we can see jobs being transferred and not lost as well as a better environment.  There are not only a few things that we can do to help, but there are also many different steps that we can all take, and now we just need to start figuring out which ones work for each of us personally.





<br><hr>

I fully agree with you, as I can also resonate with the idea that small yet consistent personal actions can be influential by making us witness more of the positive outcome. It really touched me when reading that Peter was able to make specific quantitative facts that numerically measures his carbon footprint, which would be very helpful in having a direct sense of where you release the most waste. By becoming a vegetarian, planting his own food, traveling mainly on bicycles and recycling the waste, through the reading, Peter has clearly demonstrated that personal changes, although small, are never insignificant. Just seeing his chart of his distribution of carbon release, there is no doubt that he is successful in effectively eliminating his carbon footprint by insistently holding to those actions, thus bringing benevolent impacts and positive hope that will mitigate climate change. His suggestion of a carbon fee is also an honorable approach that aims to reduce the carbon emission, as well as potentially decreasing the landfill emission. Being an environmentalist is never something easy, while Peter has shown us that, with your great persistence, you will definitely be able to influence the people around you, making bigger changes to the world.




<br><hr>

I definitely agree with you! While the Peter Kalmus film could be a little off putting at times and arguably a little discouraging because of how out of the ordinary and not achievable it seems, I found the reading to be a refreshing change of pace. His use of quantitative facts when it comes to the reduction of carbon emissions makes his lifestyle choices easier to accept and in fact I found myself encouraged to follow suit!
<br><br>


I also appreciated when he linked individual action to cultural change. After all, people are the ones who create change and oftentimes the decisions we make have the power to influence those around us and if given time, this wave will propagate over a large enough population to really create noticeable societal and cultural change. And honestly, when it comes to addressing the climate crisis, I think what America needs more than new technological developments is a change in cultural philosophy as well as societal values.

In fact, this week's reading has really changed my previous thinking. First, I always thought that there have been calls for us to protect the environment from ourselves, such as eating less beef, driving less cars, flying less and using less electricity. I've always felt that it doesn't make much difference, because the amount of carbon we use by ourselves is really small compared with that of so many people around the world. But for example, in our own life, eating less beef or not eating at all and then eating more vegetables and less traveling by plane and car have a great impact on our life. However, our contribution is indeed less than that of so many people, so I always feel that It doesn't make much sense. And even if we do this, others will not be inspired. It's hard to say that we will suddenly become enlightened and want to protect the environment and reduce carbon emissions together. However, this week's reading told me that when we start from these small things to reduce carbon emissions and protect the environment, we more or less make ourselves more involved in the society we live in, so that people in that block will have a deeper intersection with people in that block, so that people will be more likely to be inspired by our actions, Go together to protect the environment and reduce carbon emissions, so it is meaningful to do so.




<br><hr>

I agree with you! Technology can help, but it is not enough. Technological solutions work best with technological problems. The climate crisis is not a technological problem. Fossil fuels wouldn't emit greenhouse gases into the air without us. The climate crisis is a human problem in need of human solutions. 
<br><br>

If we had medicine that was great enough to heal us of every disease and disability in an INSTANT, we would lose the motivation to wash our hands, eat well, exercise, and live safely. Suddenly, we could lose all of those medicines and be left sick and unable to get better on our own. You can’t rely on medication as a coping mechanism -- you have to be able to develop your own. It's the same thing with technological advancements, most of which are simply poor excuses to continue destroying the environment. We need to have solutions that we can maintain as humans.

<br><hr>

Same here, after watching his film last year and diving more into the contextual side of his work, Peter has always came down as this down to Earth guy who takes the complexity that is the climate crisis and how we can communicate it (as we read a bit last week) as if it was a basic topic. I will admit though that the difference that I came to see between this and his film that this one dives more into the data and statistical side of his change in comparison to the film mainly covering the lighter topics and his general family's change in there urban lives. But I really really like the reading as my brain works in numbers and this was clear and coherent in explaining the impact of every single carbon based section in his life and how he in turn went around to shrink his carbon emissions 1/10th of what they use to be. 
 <br><br>
What really stuck with me in these readings was through Kalmus's "collective action" as it poses possible solutions towards many of the problems that connect between our government and the fossil fuel industries. What I loved out of this chapter is how Kalmus connected how Carbon fees would work through statistical work connecting the benefits that would derive from these fees on top of many other benefits. Before, I have been skeptical on the general carbon tax idea because of the fact that i saw it as a another tax that could have hurt the lower class families who were already struggling through putting food on the table, but Peter more or so enlightened me in seeing the greater benefits that this poses on both the family and the nation as a whole. Not only that, the many other plausible solutions that are added all through out this chapter have there own greater benefits than others (and some that I may not agree with), but in the end it will be all for the better good of the planet. 
<br><br>
However, I enjoy Peter Kalmus's work as he brings the complexity that is the climate change into a tea spoon of understanding that I believe that every average person could get behind as he himself lived an average american life before taking his great leap in reducing his carbon emissions as a whole.




<br><hr>
I feel the same way- Kalmus shifted my ideas regarding personal action too. I too resonated with "how personal action can begin to shift culture by other people witnessing change". People like to follow the mainstream, typically. So if the mainstream becomes taking actions to help end the climate crisis and save our planet, people will follow suit. That is what this planet needs in order to survive! Also, I really hope you are right about waste reduction with new smart technologies, including smart houses.





<br><hr>


Hi Jack, I also found that the reading was more enjoyable than the film. Kalmus had a lot of good points in his film but the way he went about it makes it hard to take him seriously. Yeah, I agree that his point of leading by example is one of the best things that we can do. We really need to take steps first if we want those around us to slowly make the same change. I agree that smart technology will really help us reduce a lot of waste. I really want UCSB to incorporate a more eco-friendly toilet system since it feels like it is overflushing right now. I did not know that an average US citizen waste causes about 1.3 metric tons a year. It is sad to know that US citizens waste more in a year than people in Bangladesh would in their lifetime. Ever since the other week in class, I have been really thinking about slowly becoming more climatarian and have been trying to eat more mindfully and even telling my friends about it. I have been trying to drive less and hope that my small actions can slowly make a huge impact.



<br><hr>


I definitely agree that no matter the intent, any action towards cutting the amount of waste should be considered. I also agree that Kalmus's idea of personal action being capable shifting a culture is inspiring. It seems to me that a lot of people choose to remain with their current lifestyles, free of any consideration towards the environment is due to the disheartening facts of climate change and a belief that one person's individual action is not enough in the long run. However, I believe looking past that sort of pessimism is a step in the right direction. Seeing friends implementing more sustainable diets and actions like quitting red meat or going vegetarian encourages me to implement those practices in my own life and makes it seem less daunting.



<br><hr>


I agree with your statement about the potential for a positive feedback loop to be a result of people witnessing real, tangible change. I think that since we can realize that having sustainable influences in our lives will turn personal actions into larger, collective action, we must step up ourselves and be the ones shifting culture. Kalmus mentioned that he doesn’t know the true connection between personal actions and collective action, and I agree that they work on separate levels, but I think that there is potential for collective action to be a result of individuals coming together who perform personal activism similarly. Once there is a large culture shift, the necessity of a sustainable life will be uncovered, but as of now with the knowledge we have, we must take it upon ourselves to start influencing this shift with our personal decisions. Collective activism is important and the carbon tax must be implemented, but we must focus on both because it will take both to bring our earth back to health.
<br><br>

After transitioning to a vegan diet and trying to eliminate single-use plastics from my daily life, I thought that I could call my life sustainable, but after taking this course and reading “Being the Change”, I realize how many of my actions, big or small, emit alarming amounts of CO2. I appreciate the depth that Kalmus goes into in his book and the fact that he provides his personal alternatives. Having all this knowledge and seeing the numbers of CO2 emissions relating to my daily actions, there is cognitive dissonance. I think that Kalmus is such an amazing influence and the fact that he cut his emissions by a factor of ten is truly incredible, and he actually makes it seem achievable. I hope to eliminate or exchange some of my daily practices like Kalmus, but I think what really makes him inspiring is his mindset. Not only is he optimistic, but he is mindful. He also makes his happiness a priority, which is something so essential, but often looked over when talking about the climate and how to be sustainable.

I totally agree with your opinion on this question. I also think that reading is more interesting and logical than the movie. In this reading, we can clearly see which causes global warming and how we can solve it. To let this article become more logical, readers can more easily understand and accept the information the authors want to explain and can realize what they should do next step by step.
<br><br>
In this reading, the author gives a comprehensive and completed list to people who have an interest in solving this problem from themselves, which is a really effective way. From my perspective, the reason why I did not take any action to solve the problem of global warming is that there are so many people who hold different opinions about this thing. Some people told me that you should drive an electric car; however, some people said that producing an electric car will emit a large amount of carbon dioxide. Some people said that spending less water when you take a shower is the best way. Nevertheless, some people refuted that eating less meat is the most effective method to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide. I felt confused about such a tremendous amount of information that I do not know which step I should do first. Also, the reason why I didn't do it is that I did not see people near me who also take action to solve this problem. Just like what you said, if I can see more positive change, I will be inclined to make a change in our lives. What's more, the author mentioned that doing this thing not only can solve the problem of global warming, but also benefits our own experience. I believe that this will also inspire people to take action now.

I have the same feeling as you about the straightforwardness in understanding this reading. It directly appeals to me as a college student and the new generation but I also believe that Peter Kalmus appeals to a wider range of audiences than his documentary. The structure of his book follows his story of changing his lifestyle in a way to reduce his and his family's carbon footprint. Although I find that not all the suggestions and his experience match my idea of solving the issue and are suitable for me right now, I find that his explanations on his story excellent in enlightenment and authoritative. Through uses of personal experience and data and charts from the calculation, he shows the blue map for changing our diets and lifestyles. I will for sure recommend this book to my friends and I will, if I have the chance, imitate his appliances and steps toward reducing my own carbon footprint.

I agree with you. In “Leaving Fossil Fuel”, Peter talks about why and how should we consuming less and emitting less. He argues that people don’t see value in personal reductions because they assume that individual-level reductions don’t make any difference, but he thinks this is not true. I agree with him that personal actions do not conflict with collective actions, in fact, they are mutually reinforcing each other. If you started to put in actions, people around you might get influenced by your efforts, changed their minds and join you as well, in this way we can change the cultural norms. In “Collective Actions”, he pointed out that how individual changes won’t be enough and a large scale of collective action is needed. He also talked about the importance of carbon fee, and in order to act, we need the efforts of all individual citizens to create the political space.

I had a similar reaction to the Kalmus reading for this week. I found it very interesting to read about the climate crisis from an individualistic point of view, and later having it tied into the strength of community. I enjoyed Kalmus presenting research and statistics about the climate crisis and connecting it to his own emissions and carbon footprint. He demonstrated a very strong commitment to changing his lifestyle in order to do his part towards mitigating climate change. He analyzed where his choices are flawed and actively adopted a new lifestyle and role as a consumer in present day society. I found this to be very enlightening and inspiring to read about one man's journey into doing the most he can for the planet and being a positive influence with his family and thereby educating others in an effective, respectful manner. I found Kalmus to be successful in delivering his message about the importance of changing individual habits and the power we all hold in ourselves for the better of the planet. He exemplified what we should all do and the responsibility we should all feel as well. I also enjoyed how he transitioned his piece into the flaws of society as well, such as how the climate crisis is a "market failure". This shows how if we, the people, begin to make individual change as Kalmus did, we can create a widespread movement into changing the structure of our society together. We can use the strength of numbers and redefine what our values are as a society, not attaining material wealth or constantly searching for convenience and luxury but inhabiting the planet in coexistence with all of the life around us and taking responsibility for our past actions that have let to the degradation of the planet. I believe we all need to undergo the same process of reflection and pursuit of action for the betterment of the planet and future generations to come.

I agree that the reading was much more focused on direct personal actions people could take against the climate crisis. There were parts of the film, that although contributed to a greater message of bettering one’s life, did not have any direct impact on the climate. The reading was like you said, much easier to digest and accept. 
<br><br>
I also often feel disheartened by our current situation. Your statement about a positive feedback loop definitely seems possible in theory. However, I believe that we would need to overcome a lot of inertia to see that actually happen. Even with a decent number of examples we have seen in our class, I doubt many of us will stop using personal vehicles, or even air travel. I don’t believe we would see a positive feedback loop until at least a majority of people follow some practice. 
<br><br>
I like your statement about improving technology. I believe technology will play a big role in mitigating climate change. However, I used to believe technology was much more important than I do now. After Ken presented data on what leads to the most change as well as the lack of impact electric cars have on one’s personal carbon footprint, I see that technology may not be as important as it may seem at first. Despite this, I believe technology is an important factor in our efforts to combat climate change. This could include creating more sustainable ways of producing food through technological innovation or data analysis, or fabricating a completely new model of education that is more accessible to those who do not currently have ready access.





<br><hr>
I definitely agree with you that it is crucial to make personal action witnessed by others and shift our culture. From materials in previous weeks, most of us should be convinced that it is a cultural responsibility to change the current situation and mitigate the climate crisis. Therefore, how to make a cultural change is the most urgent thing to do. Starting with our personal action, how to encourage average Americans to act the same as us or at least become aware of the severity of climate change is one of the problems Peter tries to address in his book. More positive actions would create a positive interactions between us as climate activists and average people and somehow help us change their attitudes toward climate change. Thus, they may join us to actively make progress toward our goal to mitigate the climate crisis. With their participation, we would be able to change more people’s ideology and start to shape a cultural awareness toward global warming. This is, in fact, a nice approach to change our cultural values from materialism to maybe minimalism or freeganism.

I like your points about the reading being more enjoyable than the documentary. I also thought it was heavy handed about the personal ways he lives life, instead of just focusing on the actions he's made. I found the part about the carbon tax vs cap and trade particularly interesting. I had always thought cap and trade would be a better system, because it would mean that only so many emissions can be put out. I didn't know how easily it could be corrupted. It had seemed to me like the richest would be able to get past the carbon tax in an unfair way, but I now see that it's nearly impossible to limit the ways the rich will destroy the earth.

I agree that it was easier to get through than the film. While I still liked the film and I didn’t necessarily mind the portion on meditation (I think it’s always interesting to see how people find motivation and calm in their lives) I did find the reading more helpful. I also think that seeing someone enacting change is very important in getting others to change their habits. This past year I had already begun to think more about my actions because my roommate is an Environmental Studies major and has been talking to me about what she has been learning and how she would like to work to help endangered habitats (she is particularly interested in coral and the oceans). My roommate is the one who introduced composting in our house and we now have a bucket that we all contribute to and take to the local composting site. As this class has gone on I have continued to talk to her about what we have been learning and how we can use these tips in our own lives. It really helps me continue to change my actions because I have someone else who is there with me doing the same thing.



<br><hr>
I agree with you. The content in his book can be seen as a supplement to the film, which has made me better understand his ideas. As Ken mentioned in his video, Peter has his own unique perspective on individual and collective behavior. Peter used his own experience to test the impact of personal influence. I was previously told that individual behavior has changed the climate so little that it can be ignored, which made me very desperate. But after reading Peter's book, I regained hope. "How personal action can begin to shift culture by other people witnessing change" is a good idea. If I do not take this class, I rarely realize the changes people make to improve environmental change. Witnessing their efforts gradually changed me.Now I am willing to reduce shopping and adopt diets that are more beneficial to the planet. I believe that when more people see the changes we make, they will also seriously think about climate change and improve their behavior.

I totally agree with your comment. The reading in this course actually helps us understand the climate issue more easily as it gives us more specific detail about climate change and provides possible solutions to mitigate the current climate crisis. I also agree that making a positive personal change will have a positive impact on our community. An eco-friendly lifestyle is necessary if we want to make a bigger change in our daily life.

I also feel the same way as you. It really shows me how important and how easy that our individual personal action can be so important. It is never something significants, it does not require us to be smart of professional about these topics. It is all just small things. I also feel the same that if more and more people around us start to do little things, I would feel more encouraged and willing to do. It is a positive loop that more people start to do this, we get better results, and then more people will lead more people to do these again and results getting even better. Biking is the best example. My high school was in orange county and nobody bike in that area, it is weird to bike and people do not want to be that stranger to start the first. However, UCSB is a totally different story, because everyone is biking in the school, it becomes a very normal thing. I would feel encouraged. It is nice that when you change your action, you are not only helping the world but you are influencing others and encouraging others. That is why we should really change now.

Taking this class has more than anything disheartened me in regards to the climate crisis. I know that was not the aim, but you are completely right when you say people need to create a culture of sustainability and activism. I say this because the general lack of care or attention to the climate crisis I see around me is the reason I am so disheartened. I have learned from this class how much of a massive problem it is we face and how it will be near impossible to actually fix it unless everyone instantly changes their lifestyles NOW or our government makes DRASTIC policy changes for climate action. Since I see neither happening as much as they need to be, I wonder why I should put in the effort to live sustainably if it really isn't making the big difference we need. If I was surrounded by a country of people promoting a sustainable lifestyle and everyone wanted to pitch in and do their part, I think I would most likely be very passionate about protecting the planet. However, I am now more pessimistic than ever knowing that some people don't even believe in the science of it and many more don't want to do anything about it.

I agree with you in that the reading was easier to take in than the film. In the reading he got fairly broad with what we can do to reduce our emissions rather than only showing what he has done. This was especially useful since most of the stuff that he shared in his video are things that the average low income family can do, like make their vehicle run on vegetable oil. In his book, he goes way more in depth on everyday actions that everyone can help reduce. This includes big things that we’ve heard such as driving and flying, but also other things we wouldn’t really think about such as washing and drying. He even goes as far as to break down the numbers to be fairly accurate. He teaches us how to calculate our own carbon emissions which is useful for someone who is seriously trying to cut down on their co2 emissions and wants to keep track of how much they have changed.

Hi Jack, I feel the same way that the book is easier to understand than the book. This book discusses Peter’s motivation and plan on how to reduce his carbon footprint in great detail. One most surprising thing Peter mentions in his book is that his main motivation for reducing is not directly reducing global emissions. His first reason to reduce his individual carbon footprint is that he enjoys living with less fossil fuel. He states that less fossil fuel means more connection with nature and family. Even though global warming disappears suddenly, he will continue living with less fossil fuel. I  respect his living style because he tries to reduce his carbon footprint because he truly enjoys this kind of life. I believe it is hard for anyone to become a vegetarian unless they find eating all vegetables is happy. It is quite hard for us to change our original lifestyle just because we want to reduce greenhouse gases emission. We have to find the fun of living with less fossil fuel. Take Peter as an example, he loves biking, he loves growing food, and he loves being home with family instead of away at conferences, so he doesn’t think it is painful to quit air travel or become vegetarian. He thrives on it. Moreover, burning fossil fuels with knowledge of the harm it causes can lead to feelings of guilt, panic, or depression. The easiest way to solve this problem is to align action with the principle which is burning less fossil fuel. The third reason is he believes personal reduction could indirectly help deal with climate change by influencing others' actions. As you said, personal action can begin to shift culture by changing ourselves and help others envision change.



<br><hr>


I let out a laugh while reading your description of Peter Kalmus’ tattoo because that’s exactly I thought when I was watching the documentary. Reading Peter Kalmus’ writing a week right after watching the documentary introducing his and his family’s sustainable lifestyle actually made me respect him more because through his writing you can really tell that he did complete the three phases “head”, “hand”, and “heart”, which are mentioned in the film. Especially with the parts he talked about other reasons he decided to reduce emission, “I enjoy living with less fossil fuel…I love biking…growing food...staying at home with my family instead of going to conferences.” Then he said, after knowing burning fossil fuel is extremely harmful for the environment, he felt cognitive harmony if he “aligns his actions with his principles”. These two points really demonstrate that if we truly decide to be the change, we have to find value in doing so in order to keep doing it. We need to find joy, even, and meanings. It won’t be possible if we just think that “we are the only ones who are making an effort of reducing 1/3 of our 2 metric tons emission every year”. Like he said, it would be depressing, and finally making you want to give up.

<br><br>

Kalmus also bring up tiny little things we could do in our daily lives to minimize the damage done to the planet, such as turning off the lights when we don’t really need them, preventing natural gas leakage, and avoiding food and material waste, like you mentioned in your comment. These are the things I was educated to do by my parents and teachers as early as in kindergarten, but as we grow up these things seem to be losing importance. We need to have faith in the fact that changing these little habits will make a difference.



<br><hr>
I would love to agree with you and think that making a personal change would encourage collective action and promote positive change, however I don’t think people in general care enough to do anything. Little things really do not add up, especially if no one adopts them. The only way to make a large number of people adhere to a change in their lives that may affect them so much is to place it upon them. I will, again, advocate for carbon and animal products taxes, as the best means to efficiently decrease emissions and quickly and broadly cause change in the American public’s over-consumption. People, especially Americans, will not change their way of life as quickly or as majorly as they must, and therefore they must be economically encouraged to do so. I don’t think that the method of decreasing emissions by influence is going to have any significant effect on our overall emissions on any pertinent timescale.





<br><hr>

As you pointed out, if you were able to see more positive change, you would feel more inclined to make a change yourself, which would ultimately create a loop of positive changes. I feel the exact same way too. In my opinion, it only takes one person to bring something positive and helpful to others, so that they, in return, can bring some positive changes too. For example, all of us can reduce our carbon emissions, and the carbon emissions fee can be the solution. As it was said in the reading, "a carbon fee may be our best chance for a livable planet. To get it, we citizens need to demand it." There is nothing more important than showing our interest in the change we want to make. If we really do want to live in a better, healthier planet, we need to do all our best to show how we really feel about climate change and all its consequences. It will always be up to the citizens to create opportunities for positive changes. 
<br><br>
Such things as going vegetarian, stopping to fly, and many others are essential in solving the huge problem we are faced with today. Simply not wasting food would even make a difference. 
<br><br>
Overall, I feel like when all of us start to fully understand that we are all responsible for one another, we can start living not only on a healthier planet, but also in a better world.




<br><hr>

I agree with you that Peter Kalmus’ reading is easier to understand as he uses less complicate vocabulary when he regards environmental issues. In the reading, he offers several solutions or actions that we all can do, whether it’s personal action or collective action. I respect his works and influence among his surroundings. The two reasons that he wants to reduce emissions more than a factor of 10 are enjoying living with fewer fossil fuels and aligning his actions with his principles, which both allows him to get more connection with land, food, family, friends, and community, especially with fewer feelings of guilt. Many people may think that his actions are insignificant to the environment as a whole, but he believes that personal reduction and activities can shift the cultural norms eventually if enough people do it. I think that one-day biking to work, shopping less stuff, eating a plant-based diet, and flying less could be social norms, and it is all matter of time. Just as today, people recycling plastics and reusable sources into sorted trash cans, other personal actions relating to the green environment will be more trendy. I’m positive about what we can do in the future.




<br><hr>

I completely agree with you Jack. The movie wasn't my favorite thing to watch, for the same reasons as you stated, which made me appreciate the readings more. I still like hearing about Kalmus' experience and how he's changed his life to better the planet, but it's much easier to get straight to the point through reading about it. What you said about personal action affecting others resonating with you was the same with me. I can say firsthand that people around me have hugely impacted the way I act towards climate change. Some of my very close friends are vegan and/or put in large efforts to be as climate conscious as possible, and I've definitely taken note and learned a lot from them and changed a lot of behaviors due to the way they try to help the planet. 

<br><br>

The other part you mentioned about Kalmus talking about waste was an interesting thing to bring up as well. Cutting out food waste is one big thing that I really strive for, despite the fact that the dining halls by nature waste a lot of food. I would like to, in my time here, try to strive to find a solution to that problem, whether it be donating the food to shelters in the area or something of that sort. When it comes to material waste, that's an area where I struggle somewhat. I always donate my clothes when I'm done with them, but I've learned from this class that that isn't too helpful because a lot of it goes un purchased. I could fix this by donating the clothes straight to people in need, but I'd also like to cut down on my material consumption overall, and buy less.




<br><hr>
I wholeheartedly agree with many of the points your made in regard to first and foremost the documentary on Kalmus, where we were first introduced. While illustrating his path to achieving his climate consciousness, and how he retained his happiness, the film did so in what could be described as distracting. The readings themselves were much easier to resonate with, as can be seen by so many within the comments. I feel that the readings serve as a much more adequate source of information I portraying the points he brings forward. Information that resonated with me,, included largely the statistics and data used in supporting the changes in his own life. I found interesting that he included the information to calculate our own global emissions at the end. Kalmus' openness to discuss and also dive into his own usage continued to open my eyes, as he wasn't afraid to put himself in the light of 'I am part of the problem,' which is something that can't be said for many in denial of climate change, or are proactively wishing to fix the problem, rather than just ignoring it. He also cast a light upon the common 'attempts' that have been made in combatting CO2 emissions, in regards to 'natual gas' and 'carbon fees,' of which have been widely adopted as possible solutions. While valid in their own right, Klamus is not afraid to call out where they might fall short. I also agree that economic incentives may ultimately be a great way to combat and reduce current emissions, in pairing with technology, which isn't always favored in lecture.





<br><hr>

I am agreed on your point that “how personal action can begin to shift culture by other people witnessing change.” It is important to convince others to make a change when they are not doing right, but if we want to convince others, we need to take our actions not just by saying, because it is always easier said than done. If we want to see the changes in the world, we need to be the change first. I could not agree more. If we want to call for actions to reduce the green house gas emission, we need to reduce our carbon footprints first: take public transportations, adopt child, avoid over consumerism, reduce flight travel, etc. Every one is responsible for the environment, and there is no excuse for that. We should all be the change we want to see.

I feel that these readings have been summarizing what we have been learning this whole quarter. I did however liked the way that this person was basically telling his story and how he switched over to a more sustainable lifestyle almost making it seem easy for his readers to do the same. I was astonished to read that natural gas can be really bad if there are leakages in the pipes and it's more harmful to the environment than regular carbon dioxide and coal. I was also pretty surprised to learn that only three percent of Americans are vegetarians and that the average american diet emits 2,900 kg of carbon dioxide per year so I can't even imagine how much carbon dioxide we're releasing into the atmosphere. I was lowkey disgusted at the fact that the landfills in the united states emit 1,300 kilograms of carbon dioxide per person per year and that's still way higher than peoples carbon footprint in third world countries. I really want to switch over to low energy living, however I live with 6 people in my family and it becomes really hard to take all of their wants and needs into account when trying to do these practices. It's also very hard to tell my parent's no when they take a week off of work just so that they can take us on vacation, of course I'm going to travel with them but they don't take into account the carbon impacts of their actions. I'm glad to hear that some people are coming up with easy solutions that most people can follow such as if everyone made the effort to move toward low energy living and change the collective mindset we could quickly and painlessly cut global emissions by half which would benefit all of us in the long run.



<br><hr>

I couldn’t agree with you more about the comparison between the reading and the documentary. I found the reading more straightforward for me to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the statistics of the climate crisis and to really sum up what we could do to reduce our daily carbon footprints. Also, the book is well-organized and clear comparing to the film since the contents are properly divided into different chapters and the whole picture unfolds progressively. Kalmus exposes the interconnected relationship among a number of predicaments: industrial agriculture, overpopulation, aquifer depletion, and so on, in which global warming goes to everywhere of our lives. Confronting all the problems, I do think that every small action that we take could truly contribute to the whole progress that we made to fight against the climate crisis.




<br><hr>


Hi! I agree with you! Peter Kalmus helped me understand why personal actions that can seem little are actually important. While in this course I have started to make some changes and people around me often ask why or even say that it's not going to make a difference. I was always kind of stumped on how to respond to these people. After watching last weeks film and now doing the reading it has helped me understand how I can respond to these comments. I also really liked that you picked out the idea that actions can begin to shift culture. When someone sees someone else successful doing something they are more inclined to do it as well and the more people that start to do an action the more that action becomes a normal way for people to live.



<br><hr>


I agree that the documentaries were kind of cringe worthy and hard to watch. On the bright side, they kept the same ideas and are more easily recommended to friends and family. Being motivated by the changes made by others is half of the reason I have started to adopt change in my own life. My friend Becca became a vegetarian in the later half of high school, and I have her a lot of grief over it. She slowly started adopting more and more envireonmentally conscious habits and eventually won me over as well. The conversion was not quick, and it took a lot of my own research and willingness to change to make it happen. But by following her example I have become more aware of the implications of my lifestyle. I may not be a vegetarian, but I eat way less meat and try to look for eco-friendly options whenever I'm at the store. We carpool whenever we drive home from UCSB, and take the train whenever possible. Because of this I definitely believe in the positive feedback loop created by being the change you want to see. 
<br><br>

I don't know if this is just me or not, but smart home features tend to make me more likely to waste energy. I find that I often leave the light on in my room because I forget to use my google assistant to turn them off as I go. However, I do see this being a large motivating factor for people to minimize their waste.



<br><hr>

I agree that his book was much better than the film. The film was pretty boring for me and didn't excite me much. I agree that taking action can inspire others to do the same. The more people that do something, the more accepted it is which cause even more people to take action - especially if our leaders embrace this change. With good leadership and determination, we can do anything. To add on to your point, I feel like our country can manage our waste better by separating our trash. We can have trash cans for plastics, recyclables, food, and regular trash. Our country doesn't recycle much and tends to throw these things in oceans. We should be properly recycling our plastics and composting our food waste. We can distribute this compost to farms or local gardens. We can be creative in how we deal with these issues since there is many ways to cut our emissions down.




<br><hr>
The specific chapter "Leaving Fossil Fuel" was much easier to understand than some of the other readings we have read in this class. And I do agree, easier to digest than the film "Being the Change." And yes, personal action is important to stimulate the minds and curiosity of those around you. Even if they might not agree with your reasoning, their curiosity will elicit a response from you-- which means they will now have more information regarding the Climate Crisis. What they choose to do with this information is up to them, though. All we are responsible for is setting an example, since we know the real cost of our actions. But the positive feedback loop of change is real, and does happen. That's why social movements that start small end up coming to full fruition and enacting change country-wide.
<br><br>
Yeah, human composting ("humanure" - lol) would take a lot of getting used to. Who else remembers that one movie of the guy stranded on Mars who had to grow potatoes using his own feces as manure? It seemed to work enough to keep him alive (yes, I'm aware that was just a movie, but it put the general idea out there). But regular composting is easy enough for most people to adopt! My family has been composting my whole life, and it was weird to move into an apartment in IV where my roommates didn't compost before I moved in. It seems natural-- give back to the environment the same way it gives to us.
<br><br>
 wish I had all of the facts (or just the time to gather them) surrounding my carbon emission use so I could plug numbers into the equation Kalmus provided at the end of "Leaving Fossil Fuel." I am a frequent flyer (compared to the average human) and would like to know exactly how much that overpowers my veganism, composting, reusing, recycling, electricity awareness, etc. I plan to save the "equations" he gave so I can track my carbon footprint over the next couple of months.
<br><br>
Ah, technology. It is great, but it is also half of the reason we are in this ditch right now. Sure, we might be able to create some solutions to these problems with technological advancements, but the answers are already here at our fingertips. Our problem is human greed and selfishness. Us humans think we are entitled to the finer things in life, we think we are entitled to pleasure. This is not the case. We need to be humble and gracious towards the planet after everything we have put it through.

I agree that the readings were easier to digest than the film. I responded better to the more formal, informative texts than some of the wacky things the film included. Peter mentioned less fossil fuel meant more connection with the land, food, family and friends, and the community. His reductions in many areas of his life meant a more connected, grounded lifestyle that I, as well as others I’m sure, are inspired by. He mentioned burning fossil fuel with the knowledge of the harm it causes creates cognitive dissonance. By aligning your actions with your principles, you can live a more fulfilling life. You mentioned this, but Peter said by changing ourselves we help others envision change and therefore gradually shift cultural norms. I agree with this because after watching Peter’s film and reading about his lifestyle I am extremely intrigued by several of Peter’s daily practices. I am interested in trying freeganism, or at least starting by being more aware of how much food I’m wasting. The fact that each dollar spent on new stuff accounts for .5 kilograms of carbon dioxide emissions inspired me to buy less and recycle more. There are several apps that allow you to buy secondhand clothing, often still in perfect condition and for cheaper prices. Utilizing these kinds of resources rather than spending so much on new stuff will not encourage further and more rapid production of things, therefore decreasing the world’s carbon footprint. 
<br><br>

In chapter 14 I particularly liked the idea of a carbon fee. Not only will more expensive prices deter people away from using environmentally destructive materials, but the extra money will be put back into the pockets of the people. Like Peter said, few of us will voluntarily stop burning fossil fuels in a society that rewards this behavior.



<br><hr>

I completely agree with you when you mention the fact that personal action is important as it allows us to take bigger steps in the future. Many of us don't want to take a step forward when it comes to making personal changes in terms of lifestyle because they think it would “cost” too much(time, giving up what they have now, etc.) and the effect will be very small, also others are not changing, so why should they do anything. This brings up a challenge, how should we convince others to do the same in terms of commiting to climate change? The answer is, do what you promise first, take the first step ourselves. Like what Jack said in his comment, when others witness change happening, they will begin to follow and “feel more inclined to make change” in their lives. 

<br><br>

I believe small steps forward combine could make huge differences and climate change isn’t something one person could fix or change. Making a huge step forward is hard, especially in a short amount of time, and we know that climate change is ruining the planet at an alarming rate. Dr. Kalmas turned his passion into action, marking his words with changes in his lifestyle(transportation, food, and much more), so we should do the same.




<br><hr>
So far in this class, we’ve been learning how our actions can benefit future generations. But let us also think in a “selfish way”: How our actions of reducing emissions could benefit ourselves instead of future generations. As the author mentioned, by less flying, he is able to “connect much more deeply to his local community” and to avoid the “jet-setting life: the hotels, the homesickness, the airport lines, the jet lag, and the colds I’d often catch on planes.” And, in general, living a low-energy life helps him save money. In my opinion, to achieve the ultimate goal of 0 emission, we first need to understand how our actions help ourselves and then the community. Once we can see the “positive feedback loop”, we feel more motivated to do what we ought to do.

I also found the readings easier to understand rather than the film, I felt that there was more information broken down in each section regarding the climate crisis. Although Kalmus approach to the climate crisis does seem a bit extreme, not many people are willing to give up certain items or change their ways on how they leave their carbon footprint. His 5 most effective actions in reducing were quitting planes, which was relatively the largest form of carbon being released. The second effective action was him going vegetarian, then bicycling, freeganism, and composting.  I think by incorporating some of his approaches would greatly impact the environment, but I also see many people not willing to give up their mode of transportation or take up the form of composting. I honestly wouldn't mind composting on my own, however, what makes me sort of steer away from the idea are the questions that come after, why do you do it, or the feeling of being judged because of the sole purpose of them not doing it. One of Kalmus's approach to bicycling does play a role in reducing carbon emissions from cars, it's especially quite notable here in SB because of how many people actually ride their bikes to either campus or other locations. Many people would not like the idea of biking or other public transportation, and would say "If I have a car, then I'm going to use it," even if the distance isn't that far. I used to ride my bike to work whenever I had a closing shift, but recently started carpooling with my coworkers at the end of the night, and found that much simpler then having each of us order a separate Uber or Lyft to get home. I found Kalmus' approaches a bit extreme, but believe we can all incorporate a bit of them by turning off the lights after leaving a room or when you don't need them, or that approach of switching to renewable energy.

I totally have to agree that the reading was much easier to take in when compared to the film. The film, like you said, was cringe-worthy in a sense, making it hard to ever put myself in his shoes. However, the reading was very straight forward and told the same message, without all the nonsense and filler that is found in the movie. I agree with you in the sense that some things, such as composting, will not widely adopted by average people. I also agree that things such as energy and cost-efficient smart homes could be widely adopted; however, I do not think that this would be effective if this was all people did. In fact, I know it wouldn't be effective because we already see this type of situation today. Most people have already upgraded to LEDs and other energy-efficient appliances, yet we are still screwed. While yes, this smart technology is essential, it's just not enough, and that's what I think Kalmus was trying to highlight the most. He wanted to highlight small personal action so that we may be able to start this positive feedback of climate-conscious action.




<br><hr>

I agree with your statement about why the book resonated with you more than the film. The book offered more science and made him seem like a normal citizen, like you or me. I do not think everyone will get behind composting your own feces and not everyone has the skill to build their own vegetable oil run car, but seeing someone make even a small change in their lifestyle could influence others. I know after reading and watching about Kalmus’ life, it makes the idea of making changes in my lifestyle seem attainable. His life seems normal (minus a few key things) and his family seems happy.
<br><br>


 However, realistically this lifestyle is only an option for a select few Americans. Those living in poverty, blue collar workers, and many middle class families could not afford to make or support these changes. Which is why fixing our economy and the wealth disparity in America is essential to aiding in the climate crisis. Until everyone has the opportunity to make these choices, they are only a solution to few.

I also found the reading to be easier to understand compared to the documentary. That's a very interesting viewpoint on the feedback loop and I strongly agree. I feel that the change we need will only come when others lead by example. Most people do not want to change the way they live. They don't want to give up the multiple cars in their driveway or the excess amount of clothes they buy. In reality the only way for them to see how much easier it is then it seems is for them to experience firsthand. Being the change, the documentary showed the life of peter kalmus and how he accomplished reducing his carbon emission but the book dives deeper into what we really can do.  We as a country also has to do something about the amount of waste we are producing each year. We shouldn't be using things that we don't need and end up throwing away. We have to make better decisions in terms of our comfortability or else nothing will happen that will change our current crisis.




<br><hr>

I agree with you when you said that Peter Kalmus changed your thinking on how personal action can help the climate crisis because I felt the same way after reading the two chapters of his book. What I also thought was funny but also agreeable about your comment is when you talked about Kalmus’ mediation scene and the matching tattoo to go along with it. That aspect made me feel disconnected from Kalmus and what he was explaining about the climate crisis. On another note, the readings did seem different from the documentary but in a good way, and I agree with Kalmus that personal action is really important when trying to combat the climate crisis. As Ken has said in the lecture that we need a culture change if we want a fight chance at saying our planet for future generations. Even though personal action is important I do not feel that Americans can be easily persuaded into changing their lifestyles so the federal government needs to give our citizens a little push because this is one of the most important issues facing the way today. Legislation and persona; action combined is what America needs to do and then the rest of the world can follow in order to secure a livable planet for our future generations. People need to know that the solution to the climate crisis is not one major idea, but actually a collection of personal action, legislation, and laws, as well as smart technology if we want to stop emitting fossil fuels and reverse the already bad effects that we have currently experienced.

I agree that this reading was much easier to understand and put things into perspective in comparison to the documentary. The message was much more clear to apply to my daily life choices and didn't frame these lifestyle changes in a way so only the financially privileged could implement them into their lives. The way that our culture continues to work in the way it does is by individual action and engagement. If these things change, so will our culture with some time. This means that our destructive habits we engage with now are not a permanent decision despite feeling uneasy about giving up certain things like everyday car use and meat consumption. I agree that a positive feedback loop is what will progress our country and therefore the world into a more sustainable way of living. It will hopefully provide us a sense of pride in doing so rather than a feeling of deprivation, as I think this is most people's concern when faced with the choice to make changes. This was the case with my own choices because meat has always been a huge part of my diet throughout my life and I couldn't really imagine just cutting it out completely cold turkey. I've taken steps to work towards a plant-based diet by transitioning slowly because I realize it will be a more effective and permanent lifestyle change. Should we take the same approach on a larger scale, it would reflect how much easier it is to transition rather than making instantaneous, cut and dry changes.



<br><hr>

I agree with you. This book shows how did the author Peter Kalmus be changed to reduce the carbon emission and protect the environment. I am so shocked that He can insist to ride the bike, reduce food waste, and use the composting system in the backyard. I think the car that could use waste vegetable oil instead of petrol is definitely a great idea. It alters the way how carbon is emitted back to the air. Not only did Peter Kalmus make a contribution to protecting the environment, but other people also influenced by such a lifestyle. If we can have more repair cafe in the community, there will be less waste produced, and every little step you make contributes to a better environment.




<br><hr>
I agree that the largest impact of personal changes will be a culture shift. Doing this could change public sentiment so that they are more willing to vote for policies that combat climate change. Adopting something like the carbon fee/dividend could be attainable if the general public found it to be necessary.





<br><hr>

My perspective on personal action was also greatly shifted by these two chapters of Being the Change. I really liked Kalmus’ succinct explanation as to why he thinks that our personal habits can make a difference; I especially appreciated his acknowledgement that that CO2 he is saving from entering the atmosphere is certainly only a drop in the bucket, but important nonetheless. He gave three arguments for personal action: 1 - living without fossil fuels can be even more enjoyable than living with them, 2 -  it feels much better to align your actions with your beliefs, and 3 - your own actions are a small step towards shifting the culture by inspiring others to live similarly. 
<br><br>
The reason that resonated with me the most was the 2nd. After spending so much time learning about what must be done to curb fossil fuel emissions, and pointing a finger at huge corporations for the damage they have caused, it only feels right to acknowledge my place in the cycle of capitalism, and do my best to remove myself from it. As other students in the class have pointed out, I’m currently not in a position to make some of the changes Kalmus did like human composting and driving a car that runs on vegetable oil, but others, such as eating locally grown produce, limiting my animal product intake, living with less belongings and using alternate forms of transportation than driving are all within my reach. Making these changes make me feel a little more at peace with myself and even the state of the world.




<br><hr>


I agree that technology can definitely help us as humans out in reducing waste. However, it is us that need to make the initial drive to reduce climate change and be aware of all the problems we make. This reading made it easier for me to visualize a world where everyone is committed to making changes to improve the climate crisis. Once one person makes a few personal changes, people notice it. When they notice it, they question it and then learn about it. Learning turns into doing, which is the ultimate goal of helping the climate crisis.



<br><hr>

While I agree with you on many points made in your comment, such as the importance of shifting the culture through personal action, I have to disagree with you when you say a large amount of waste will likely be cut out simply to save money for users. Unless there is a pressure put on them for another reason, companies often don't just try to help users save money out of the kindness of their hearts. The simple pressure of trying to get more customers won't do. Think about food, for example. If anything, the idea of saving money has pushed more waster, as now, customers often buy much larger portion sizes because it's cheaper per amount of food. While they are technically saving money if you looked at it per unit and the amount of units they have,  they usually end up wasting more because it doesn't all end up being eaten. Although this example is more on the consumer end, I feel like this can be seen elsewhere as well. Why would electric companies help create or encourage the use of a self-shut off light bulb when they can just leave it on and make more money? The only way to actually start reducing waste is to stop it individually and to put pressure on companies environmentally to help reduce it as well.




<br><hr>


I agree that action inspires action. As I have mentioned in previous comments, I made a shift in my eating habits after coming to college and seeing my peers eat much healthier than me. This was a small change that I made that has made a lasting positive impact on my health and my ability to contribute to a healthier environment. I think much of the larger changes that need to be made are going to be made at a federal level. This is why it is harder to inspire change in citizens nationally. There are also so many different kinds of culture present in America that adhere to different eating standards. There is also the enormous uneven distribution of wealth and education. In wealthier areas, this idea certainly stands tall. However, there are many parts of the country where this change isn’t seen as necessary. I believe it is imperative to distribute environmental information to everyone, not just the people that have the resources to make the change. Technology certainly is helping diffuse this knowledge, and I hope it continues to evolve to support the environment and people’s recognition of their role in keeping it healthy.



<br><hr>
Jack Taylor  I agree with you. Those changes in habits each individual made could have a major effect in mitigating the climate crisis. If each of us started using bikes, the cumulative effect would be incredible. Therefore, we should communicate the idea of changing our daily habits to other people frequently. For instance, I keep telling my friends the benefits of owning a bike and using it to commute. Not only does it shorten the time I spent everyday on the road, but it also gives a pleasure ride, during which I can enjoy the view of the beautiful Goleta.




<br><hr>
Your take on seeing change sparking a cultural shift is a good one. We often follow trends and adopt change when it comes to pop culture, so why can't this be the case for environmental action. If celebrities were promoting climate activism as much as they did their music or films or highlights, then some change will occur. I am not necessarily saying this will result in a revolution, but it will be a step forward. But on a personal level, there is always something we can do to bring about change in our own lives. Kalmus' book offered valuable insight as to the things we can do to spark change. Others may not adopt the same exact methods that you implement, but it may push to adopt some adaptation of it. With that being said, I feel like most of Kalmus' suggestions were quite extreme or drastic to the common citizen, but I believe it is more effective for many people to collectively make minimal or decent changes in their lifestyle than for a handful to make these drastic changes.

I think the same way that the reading "Being the Change" by Peter Kalmus is better understanding and easier accepting. As it throw away the common article structure of having deep discussion about climate changes by showing many complicated and professional data and research, and discuss the topic we will concern in our daily life  in a more simple and straightforward way.  Just like the discussion of the incentive for people to take actions cutting the carbon emission and how can people solve this question. This is my daily concern too. I always have the same concern about wether to do things in my way or an environmental-friendly way. Of course, do things in my way , like having more meat in a meal as usual i did, taking a uber when i am out, is much more comfortable and make things easy. But actions like eating more plant-based food can help climate change.  Those thoughts keep struggling me. So, it's important for me to have motivation to keep taking actions to cut Carbon emission. After reading this,  i found the method of enjoying life with less fossil fuel to be pretty important and effective. Also, structuring the reading by showing his own emission profile make many information more intuitive.

“Leaving Fossil fuel” and “Collective Action” are interesting chapters to read because there is more in-depth discussion about the movie "Being the Change". Although Peter tries his best to reduce his carbon footprint, it still be hard to change the overall situation but create minor slow down of the trend. I think the world already dominated by fossil fuel because there are too much industries depend on it, so as many of consumer products. Without the development of replacing resources, governments and societies will still depending on fossil fuel. Our generation has better awareness about protecting environment and sustainability since there are more information channels for us to explore the climate crisis topic. But, consumerism as the mainstream driver to our culture still pushing people to purchase more and waste more without the notice of consequences. For instance, a household could continue its lifestyle without asking “when all the trash go?” and even grow “I didn’t see it, so is not a problem to me” attitude.

I really enjoyed this reading of the two chapters, “Leaving Fossil fuel” and “Collective Action”  from "Being the Change" because they go further in depth about some of the topics we have discussed in this class. I liked the fact that Peter took the time to do research and make sure his information is factual and can be backed up by studies and statistics. Often times when I am trying to discuss the whole climate crisis with people I am at a loss of ideas about facts that I have heard before/learned in English 22 and English 23, but with texts like these I feel like I can refer back to them and share them with others. I was actually surprised how much more drastic some of these changes will have in our overall emissions of CO2 compared to what I thought before, for example I was surprised how much switching to using clothes lines to do laundry could reduce our carbon footprints. Although this change may be a little inconvenient to those who rely on  machines, it really isn't that difficult and can be done by all. Overall I think he proposes a lot of great ideas.

I really like how in the chapter “leaving fossil fuel” Peter Kalmus addresses everything he was doing wrong. Most people won’t admit all the things that they are doing badly. He gave us ways to fix what he was doing because let’s be honest most of us are doing the same. I thought that was pretty cool. The numbers he gave too were so astonishing I had no idea how much America’s were emitting. In the other chapter “collective action” I like how he started out with a quote from Nicholas Stern “climate change is a result of the greatest market failure the world has seen.” He gives so many great ideas on how to change our ways in this chapter as well and how it would benefit us. For example, he gave one example of british columbia’s economy and how it grew. He backed up his facts which makes it more credible as well.

Peter Kalmus's book "Being the Change" was very informative and I personally feel like it adds to his documentary because it feels more like an academic research article rather than a film. In his book, he takes the time to meticulously detail the effects and plausibilities of a list of solutions that can be taken to combat climate change. For example, when he discusses the carbon fee and dividend, he specifically notes that a $30 per tonne CO2e fee would increase the price of gas by 34 cents per gallon, but it would also amount to a $600 annual dividend per person. By listing out both the pros and cons, and giving an example that is easy to follow and understand, Kalmus is able to show that the benefits outweigh the detriments of the carbon fee. Moreover, the book also gives potential climate change solutions that will not work as well. He explains to the readers how cap and trade won't work because it is easily exploitable, expensive, and complicated and goes in depth detailing why that is. The inclusion of both solutions that will work and those that won't show that Kalmus has researched and exhausted the methods that can be done to fight climate change, and he doesn't just pick to write about solutions that are convenient and flashy to the reader. This exemplifies how massive the problem of climate change really is, and depicts that if we are really serious about having a future on this planet that we can't just sit back and wait for someone else to fix it.

In this week’s reading “Being the Change”, I really appreciate the transparency of the author and how honest he was with his personal actions in helping mitigate the climate crisis. I feel like oftentimes, we fail to change our actions because we fail to truly quantify just how much damage we are doing to the environment. However, in these chapters, the author Peter Kalmus does a great job in helping to numerically visualize just how much our carbon footprint is. Personally, I feel like this is effective in illustrating just how far our personal actions can take us. Whenever we may think that our small actions won’t make a difference, it’s important to realize that having that mentality is a part of the problem and the reason why there is no true systematic change–and there are numbers to prove it! I really thought it was interesting how small changes can dramatically reduce your carbon footprint and cut your emission rate significantly. A very important point that Kalmus also brought up is that people can still live normal lives given these changes. This is important to emphasize because many people fear that the climate crisis will cause us to have to change our entire lifestyle and get rid of all of our nice things. Although these changes may require some sacrifice, it is completely doable and it goes to show that you can still live a happy and healthy life.

In response to the chapter “Collective Action”, I thought that the carbon fee and dividend idea was very interesting. I was kind of iffy about the Carbon tax because it’s difficult to tax everyone when the main people who it would be affecting is the lower/working class. However, the idea of the carbon fee and dividend is something I never thought about. The fact that the money collected will be equitably returned back to the people would most likely help the policy gain more support from others.

<p>

Early on in the chapter “Leaving Fossil Fuel,” the author (Peter Kalmus) details why he personally chose to reduce his greenhouse gas emissions. His reasons really resonated with me because as someone who is also trying to reduce their emissions, he very clearly outlined the benefits I’ve been feeling and seeing. 

<br><br>

First, he talks about the fact that he likes the lifestyle that he’s designed with less emissions. Personally, I’ve found myself feeling the same way. I’ve been actively choosing to bike or walk when I could theoretically drive instead, and it’s given me a lot of meaningful “me time” that I wasn’t finding as frequently before. Additionally, trying to move more towards a plant-based diet has helped me discover some really delicious, healthy foods that make my body and my soul feel good. Kalmus mentions that his new lifestyle makes him feel “more connection with the land, with food, with family and friends, and with community.” While I can’t say as much about the latter half of that statement, I’ve definitely been feeling more connection with the land and with my food.
<br><br>


Another point Kalmus brings up is that reducing his emissions has made him feel that he’s aligning his actions with his principles. I, too, can very much relate to this. I’ve known for quite some time that I could reduce my emissions, but I couldn’t push myself to do it until I took this class. Ken & the content he’s given us has shown me that even though my individual reductions aren’t going to save the planet, it’s a step in the right direction. I cannot imagine going through this entire course and not feeling the need to change anything about my daily habits. Actively trying to reduce my emissions gives me the peace of mind of knowing I’m at least attempting to help the planet more than hurt it. It’s not perfect, but it’s a start.



</p><hr>


<p>
One of the things I found most interesting from the reading in "Leaving Fossil Fuel" was the layout of simple, everyday tasks and how much they affect the carbon footprint that we give off. He provides multiple examples in a list format of how, say, drying clothes in a dryer, or using a cell phone charger, all give off certain amounts of energy, and therefore require far more energy and electricity than necessary and is good for the earth. I like seeing the breakdowns of how each little action can impact the climate crisis; it helps me understand why it's so hard for individual efforts to actually make a difference- they simply become overshadowed by the sheer abundance in which fossil fuels are utilized by everything we use in society. 
<br><br>

I especially likes the example he gave of a time when a woman, who was an avid believer in global warming and climate change, came up to him after a presentation completely distraught because while she knew the harmful affects of flying, it was seen as a requirement for her to fly because of her job as a nurse in Africa. I think this example was really great solidifying the earlier concept mentioned- every individual action will always be overshadowed by the broader span of actions that, even if they aren't done frequently, emit so much greenhouse gas or generally bad stuff into the atmosphere that the individual ones don't even make a dent into the effects of climate change. It's hard because it makes it really discouraging for the average person to hear that our individual actions don't have that much of an impact on the crisis, but it should never dissuade a person from completely giving up personal actions to limit your carbon footprint. 
<br><br>

It simply comes down to the fact that individual action will likely never be able to reverse the effects produced by huge corporations and politicians/leaders who don't or never did see the benefit in doing things to control the effects of climate change before it got the stage it's at right now- but that shouldn't stop you from still doing what you can to help. Changing or modifying your diet, buying less, downsizing, limiting harmful traveling and transportation practices, etc; they will all benefit the Earth, even if it isn't noticeable in the grand scheme of the situation.

In the book “Being the Change”, the chapter “Leaving Fossil Fuel” broke down the personal lifestyle changes that Peter Kalmus has made to reduce his household’s carbon footprint. To me, this seemed to reiterate what Kalmus’s film, as well as the expanded ideas in lecture, discussed-- the effects of heavy fossil fuel use in transportation, housing, food, etc. His chapter “Collective Action”, however, was really interesting to me because it explains the ways in which the government can help with curbing fossil fuel use. I have heard of a carbon tax, which is quite self-explanatory in its name, only heard of cap-and-trade but never knew what it entails, and have never heard of a carbon fee. I really enjoyed learning about these policies in detail, especially the way that a carbon fee would be the most effective. I would fully support a carbon fee policy as it seems to be the most fair to both the environment and individuals, regardless of socioeconomic standing. And Kalmus’s point about how Republicans or Libertarians are more likely to support this type of environmental policy makes me think that the idea could potentially work out; information on carbon fees definitely requires more exposure in the media and other publicity outlets to show how it is a net positive.



</p><hr>


<p>

Out of the two chapters of Peter Kalmus’s “Being the Change”, “Collective Action” felt the most impactful to me. Ken’s biggest recommendation for us to help combat the climate crisis is to vote for the most environmentally supportive candidates and I couldn’t help but wonder what all that entailed. Sure it would be great if they simply love the planet and want to make it a better place, but how collectively could a politician really do that? Sure they could ban fracking in California, and force companies to bring down emissions, but those all seemed like small solutions to a very big issue. I recalled that Ken mentioned the carbon tax before, but I didn’t really understand quite what it meant, and truth be told whenever I hear the words “implementing tax”, I begin to hear my dad ranting on about how the government just wants to take all our money, in the back of my head. Therefore, reading the proposed details of a climate tax, or rather fee, and how it could impact the economy was very helpful to me and I am in full support. Admittedly, I was a bit confused on how the return sum of money would work at the end of the year- if the idea was for people to use less gas for example to save money, what would be the incentive if they’re just getting it back at the end of the year anyways? Shouldn’t there be some net difference? Maybe I simply misunderstood this part, but if someone could clarify, I’d greatly appreciate it!

Though this course I feel that we have learned about the effects of flying among other things, like freeganism and the use of eco-friendly daily choices, but what I really appreciated about this article was the use of diagrams.  Reading an article with facts is very useful at persuading a reader, but like we learned in last week’s reading, the way one conveys information can change the way the viewed interprets it entirely.  In this case, I liked how the picture of bubbles that coincide with the amount of reductions that Peter Kalmus has made, considering it really put the statistics of how a certain action can affect the environment into perspective.
 <br><br>
I enjoyed reading about how living low energy would save money.  Unfortunately, in our greed driven world, that is something I think would be a big incentive to people who don’t even believe in climate change.  If everyone were to start saving energy merely because they would be saving money, that would still be enormously helpful and would curb emissions.  It is good that he talks about taking baby steps into self-awareness that would eventually translate to a good amount of energy (and money) savings.
  <br><br>
     What was extremely interesting to me was how Kalmus talked about carbon offsets and why they do not work.  While I was in APES (AP Environmental Science), we would talk about using carbon offsets politically and as a tradeoff for companies that ask for permission to do something bad environmentally.  Mitigation was like currency, and it inspired me to hear of politicians that would support carbon offsets and mitigation in lieu of allowing just anyone to do whatever they want.  It was a shock to me, though now very understandable, how it does not work easily because of the standards that the companies, who are temporary themselves, have to be held to.

After reading this week’s article “Being the Change” by Peter Kalmus, I am more determined to make some changes to my lifestyles. This article mainly focus on carbon footprint, and each one American’s average is greater than the average Bangladesh, which is astonishing to me. This is unfair to those who contribute minor parts of climate change but need to suffer the most from it. Also, it’s more eyeopening to see the data about it, which is more visually to see the severity of climate change. However, even thought now the situation is worse, we still have time to reverse all these problems, as long as we take action right now. If we continue polluting our Earth, soon after, our home will become a truly uninhabitable planet.

“Less fossil fuel has meant more connection with the land, with food, with family and friends, and with community”
  <br><br>

The fourth paragraph under the section titled “Why reduce in the first place?” really struck me; we continue to emit greenhouse gases, burn fossil fuels, “invest” in fast fashion, eat meat, drive cars, and engage in hundreds of other harmful acts despite our knowledge of the harm that it creates. This leads to cognitive dissonance, which can in turn lead to guilt, sadness, depression… the cure for this? Doing whatever we can to work toward actually mitigating the climate crisis. Helping other people feels good, and the best motivations are intrinsic motivations; every single climate solution that we have discussed helps people indirectly, and often lines up with one’s own morals and beliefs. What I’m saying is that the solutions to climate change don’t have to be difficult, they don’t have to mean “giving up” anything—in fact, they can lead to overall greater happiness and satisfaction in life. 
  <br><br>

“By changing ourselves, we help others envision change”. This could not be truer. It reminds me of the saying “be the change you want to see in the world”; sometimes you have to take the initiative, you have to take matters into your own hands, rather than expecting someone to start and for you to follow in their footsteps. Instead, be the one who’s footsteps are followed.  
  <br><br>

In regards to air travel, we are well aware that it is the quickest most efficient way that any human can warm the environment. However, I had barely thought about the other consequences of air travel; “Indeed, modern air travel is the ideal way for a local outbreak to spread into a pandemic”. Reading this sentence immediately made me think of COVID-19 (the coronavirus), which we are currently battling; it was failed to be contained at its origin, and began to spread exactly as he stated--through air travel--and it is only spreading more quickly and viciously. If changing your flying habits for the sake of the climate wasn’t enough, not flying in order to avoid a potentially deadly virus should be.

Looking at food consumption habits, I really appreciate the idea of “freeganism”. Not only is it better for the environment and more affordable, but it is also extremely flexible. I feel as though some people are scared away from vegetarianism and veganism due to the strict “guidelines” that are imposed, as well as the negative social views that some people associate with these diets. Furthermore, vegan diets can be expensive, especially since fresh fruits and vegetables cannot be bought in large quantities due to their short shelf life. Freeganism is a much more adaptable and accommodating preference, allowing one to make as many changes as they want/can without feeling badly about not fulfilling the “requirements” to the max. As mentioned in the reading, freeganism alone can reduce food emissions by 1000kg CO2e per year.

I agree that for those that recognize the consequences of their actions, major cognitive dissonance would start to disrupt a person's mind. If nothing else, they are harming their family's future generations and that is likely to make everyone question their behavior. It is probably a matter of people not recognizing the consequences that cause them to continue in wasteful practices. I will point out that I do in a way question the insistence on purely doing every kind of labor by hand without any sort of manufacturing of any kind. From what I say in the case of Peter was that things were just sort of generally dirty and a bit unattractive and reminiscent of an 18th century life. I don't believe that the lifestyle has to look the way they make it look in order to be sustainable.

Hi Chloe! The first part of your comment really stood out to me. I feel like taking individual action to reduce your carbon footprint can actually lead to more satisfaction and happiness. I still think it's important to recognize that we are in a privileged position to take steps to living more sustainable lifestyles. That privilege also presents us with an opportunity to rethink our values/overall lives and be able to create a greater sense of community with those around us. I can personally say that ever since I took up climate activism I have found that I feel like the actions I take are meaningful. It's been something that makes me feel happier and more satisfied with my life, knowing that I am contributing to something bigger than myself. It definitely has helped me create a better sense of community with those around me and I've met some of the coolest, most amazing people since I started taking part in more activism. I consider myself a little bit of a climatetarian and becoming more conscious but the impact of the foods I eat has helped me create a more meaningful connection with food and how it is produced and whatnot. I also just think that taking action to reduce fossil fuel consumption just helps you be more grounded in your values. Overall, I really do agree that the consumption of less fossil fuel does mean more connection with land, food, family/friends, and community.

This reading assignment was fairly easy to digest, which for a reader that is relatively new to the global climate change scene - is a large positive.  I agree that freeganism is a great alternative to the american diet, yet I think many people won’t be excited to go “dumpster diving”. Some might be up for the idea , like Peter, but if we were to consider which climate diet would be more effective with a larger american population, then it would be the climatarian diet. 
  <br><br>
Helping people does in fact feel good and I wish more people would realize that. Our society is so focused on being individual and self absorbed in everything we do. If we were to take a step back and take a look at what our individualistic culture has done to our planet and our lives - we’d surely be disgusted. Take a look at COVID-19 through this lens as well. People rather sell water bottles and masks at ridiculously high prices then to be a kind neighbor and share with the community. It reminds me of the short video we saw in class - where the fishermen were better off when getting the necessary amount of fish and not overindulging. Same goes with water and masks and all the other stuff people are stockpiling in their houses. 
  <br><br>

Unfortunately, I think it will be a long while before the american people’s values align with those of Peter Kalmus. Even though people are good hearted and generally not evil or malicious, I still think it will be hard for people to transition to a more sustainable life if they don’t see a change in infrastructure and policy.

I completely agree that we don’t have to “give up” anything in order to be happy and to help the earth. The lifestyle that is recommended that we need to follow in order to reduce our carbon emission is very similar to the lifestyle that kids my age and older lived. For example riding a bicycle to get to places, being less into the consumerism lifestyle, etc. being a kid was the best time of anyone's life and why wouldn’t we want to live the rest of our life like that. 
  <br><br>

We can change the ways that we live to make us happier but the sad thing is that sometimes we cannot change the way that we live because some people don’t have the flexibility to do that. In order to live a life that Kalmus lives in, people would need to have more free time and some people can’t afford to live that way because they need to work 50+ hours a week just to support their family. We need to change the way that society works in order to accomodate for those who can’t live this way. We almost have to live like a utopian society to all help the earth together. 
   <br><br>

Freeganism sounds like the greatest thing in the world, someone who doesn’t like some free food. Free food always tastes the best. We need to encourage restaurants to donate their food that they have left over at the end of the day we need to ask them to feed the ones in need instead of throwing it out.

Great comment! Just like you said in the comment, “Less fossil fuel has meant more connection with the land, with food, with family and friends, and with community”, I do share the same opinion. In the reading leaving fossil fuels, the author gives statistical data about the impact people can have on using fossil fuel-based transportation such as planes and cars. Just like the professor mentioned before in the lecture, even though the planes only take up about 2% of the total carbon emission, it still generates more CO2 into the atmosphere per person. The author mentioned that he transfers from fast travel to slow travel, which helps him to focus on the trip it self more. I feel the same way, I think people, especially under this period of time, are forgetting about the importance of travel, that is, the travel itself. Like professor said in the lecture, many people now are focus more on the destination instead of the travel. If we use this method, it can bring more connection between our lives and our environment.

I really enjoyed reading Peter’s chapters from his book, Being the Change. I loved his name for his car, Maeby. As is maybe it’ll make it, and maybe it won't. Lol. I also thought it was a wonderful idea to transform it into a car that runs on grease. It ensures the grease is put to good use while helping lower his carbon footprint. Just a total win-win. I also never stop being surprised at how damaging our diets are, and he lays the numbers out so well. Also just how much we as individuals have the power to change how we travel, what we eat, how wasteful we are, etc is really exciting to read about because it really feels like there’s something all of us can do to help combat climate change. 
   <br><br>
In his other chapter on collective action, I found the carbon fee and dividend(CFAD) especially compelling. I think it’s a brilliant idea that obviously can help us lower emissions and do so in a fast and pragmatic way. But at the same time, it’s discouraging to see that many people on the right and even some on the left don’t see this a great fix. I hate that so many ideas get politicized. It bogs down progress, society, and is now harming the climate. Politicizing climate change or ideas is what’s stalling our progress towards a better world, and we need to stop doing this if we are to try and keep the planet relatively the same for the foreseeable future.

The distinction between environmentalism and biospherism was a good way of enlightening readers of the wrong way we are approaching our relationship with environment. Environmentalism has a tendency to polarize people from different walks of life because of its emphasis on crisis and grand mistakes we committed against the biosphere. I remember we read "The Uninhabitable Earth" and that reading was criticized to be alarmist and I remember arguing that the state of panic and urgency he is imposing is crucial to diverting people's attention towards this issue. I don't think I was wrong completely, but I realized that intimidating statistics is not necessarily entirely effective in generating concern for the environment. That may catch people's attention for a time and give them a sense of anxiety and panic of what's to come but the path to saving the planet needs to be slowly developed and integrated, not forced urgently. 
  <br><br>


Peter Kalmus describes “biospherism” as a “transition to a way of life that respects the limits of the biosphere and all life. Sounds pretty chill. On the other hand, “environmentalism” is described more like a war against our own people- “to protect the environment from humans.” I am not saying it’s wrong because it is a war against our own degenerate habits, however, I am also not saying it is effective inviting people who disagree. Biospherism accepts that everyone contributes to both the problem and the solution. And, the people that don’t care are not to blame, they are part of the blame but we are too. Changing the sentiments of environmentalism to biospherism is a first step to a more united approach to finding balance with the biosphere, with each other, and with ourselves.

<p>
Kalmus’ actions to reduce his carbon emissions clearly reflect everything we have been learning in class so far, showing that his lifestyle is both viable and effective. For example, cutting flying out of his life greatly reduced his carbon footprint, as becoming vegetarian and growing his own food. I like how as a scientist, he includes facts and statistics, which makes it easy to compare his emissions in 2012 versus 2014 and see how much of an impact his personal actions made in just two years. I found his section in Chapter 9 about “Why reduce in the first place?” to be inspiring and informative. It acknowledges a primary reason why many people fail to make changes, even when they do somewhat believe in the climate crisis - they simply do not think their actions will make a difference, so why bother? However, by pointing out the personal satisfaction he got out of reducing his carbon emissions and the morality of doing the right thing and taking action for something you believe in, he shifts the focus away from being intimidated by the enormity of the problem compared to how small we are. His work also demonstrates his last point about shifting our culture, first by spreading awareness and information as well as making it a “norm.” After all, these solutions will not solve anything unless they are carried out by us, and doing so requires a change in cultural values and mindsets.

This was by far my favorite reading in this class so far. I loved how it wasn’t just filled with a ton of facts and statistics, but instead came from a point of view of self and mindfulness. The author states that, “I now realize that few people respond to facts. I also realize that I can’t respond meaningfully to our predicament with my intellect alone. I also doubt that even our society’s collective intellect, our best scientists and brightest policymakers working within their delineated roles, will be enough. While intellect certainly plays a role, it’s a rather small one. Our dire ecological crisis calls us to go deeper.” I found this quote to be so touching because I agree with deeply with it. I have come to realize how much facts turn people off, myself included. I’ve always believed that emotion, compassion, and mindfulness allows a more profound connection with the people around you and especially with the people you come to have conversations with- especially the “Uncle Pete” type of people.
  <br><br>
“Time and again I’ve found that only by taking a step— making some actual change— is the next step revealed. I find that all the planning and intellectualizing in the world can’t substitute for just doing something. There’s wisdom in doing.” This quote reminds me when Ken said change isn’t wisdom if it is not acted on. I too have realized that as soon as I step into the mindset of changing just one thing about my lifestyle, I am motivated to make another step and another; a new door to change opens every time you enter that first door-and I can honestly say, the entering of the new doors is always fulfilling and a joyous experience. 
  <br><br>
 “Somewhere within our industrial mindset, there’s a place called Away. When something breaks, or bores us, we throw it in the garbage and trash collectors take it Away. We flush a toilet and invisible pipes take it all Away. However, we are slowly learning that Away was always really just Somewhere Else, because everything is connected.” This quote really resonated with me because lately, my new struggle has been this idea of recycling and throwing things away. I have been having a battle with my conscious every time I throw something out. I ask myself, “what’s the point of putting this in the right bin or even in a bin at all when I know it all ends up somewhere on this planet.” Of course, I know the benefits of recycling, but I am often torn with the idea that my clothes and E-waste now matter how I dispose of them are ending up somewhere…away. This way of thinking helps me be more aware of what and when I purchase things and the idea that I will eventually have to discard of this item, which has ultimately led to me purchasing less so that I throw away less. 
  <br><br>
I found this reading inspiring and motivating and I definitely plan on reading all of the material once I have a little more time on my hands!

I agree with you that his self mindfulness really helped convey his message and further his cause. Although this wasn't my favorite reading due to the repetitive nature of the text, his writing style made it none the less enjoyable. His way of meticulously calculating the impact of his individual actions gave it a type of grass root movement and a sense that the reader could also make similar strides in saving the environment. His way of humbly presenting solutions although he is clearly very educated on the subject makes the reading more accessible to all individuals.
  <br><br>
The reason I really liked the movie and this text was due to the things you mentioned about him approaching this from a wholistic point of view. That quote also really resonated with me as I also think that a cultural/mindset shift will be the only real solutions to climate change. As long as we are in the mindset of consuming, the environment will never have time to adapt to our emissions. He made me think that the environmental issues arising are a reflection of issues present in Man's mind and how interwoven nature and man are.
  <br><br>
Although this goes against the very mindset that helped create the issue, I really hope that technological progress allows for the proper disposal of waste that will give us more breathing room to still have some disposal items. I say this because I don't think that waste is as much of an issue as other serious climate threats such as the beef industry. I don't 100% agree with the idea that waste is entirely bad.



<br><Hr>
I also really enjoyed the quote about having to go deeper with the crisis. No notable change will be able to occur if we don't bring emotion into it. Facts alone cannot save us, action has to be brought forward, and action tied in with emotion will be much stronger and long lasting. This method of communication is crucial to people who are unwilling to listen or completely ignore the facts that are given to them. 
  <br><br>
I also connected with the quote, "Somewhere within our industrial mindset, there's a place called Away." We don't really take time to consider where the things we are throwing out are really being sent. Earlier in this course, we discussed fast fashion and the clothes that are now being donated to placed like Goodwill and the Salvation Army. Most of those clothes end up not being sold and are instead ending up in landfills in other countries. People who donate their clothes believe that they are doing good by doing that instead of throwing them out, but if most people are donating their clothes, not enough people are buying them out. It ends up being a continuous cycle of clothes being sent away somewhere where people assume they will continue to be used. The result, however, is that the clothes would have been better off being upcycled instead of being sent away.

I agree with everything you said in your comment, especially the bit about how this reading was not full of facts and statistics, but “came from a point of self and mindfulness”. I truly expected the reading to be extremely factual and number-heavy considering Peter Kalmus is a scientist and all. However, I was pleasantly surprised to read that Kalmus was not interested in writing about the climate crisis from a scientists point of view (mainly because, as he notes, “few people respond to facts”), he simply wanted to write this book from the point of view of someone who cares about the environment and changed their lifestyle because of this. I personally found this approach to be much easier to read, especially considering I’m not a NASA scientist. 
  <br><br>
I also really liked the quote from the book that you included in your comment (“Time and again I’ve found that only by taking a step— making some actual change— is the next step revealed. I find that all the planning and intellectualizing in the world can’t substitute for just doing something. There’s wisdom in doing.”). While doing the reading, it didn’t really jump out at me, but your view on this quote really changed my perspective about it and I see its meaning much more clearly now. Now that I have this wisdom, I hope I can take the next step and act upon it.

I agree with you, this is also by far my favorite reading. I grew tired of hearing people claiming individual actions are meaningless when it's actually not, Kalmus gives a lot of great examples of why personal actions matter, as well as how we can practically make some personal actions. Moreover, Kalmus' writing style really hook my mind, I can tell his compassion and patience easily throughout the readings. Making a connection back to last week reading, I think his articles made a great example to show the art of proper communication, which I have been struggled to learn. What he writes are still fact, but he shows us his perspective just enough to make connections, I felt resonating when reading them especially they speak out for me but I was to write many of what I wanted to deliver will be missing. This is especially obvious when I consider how similar his point of views and mindset we share, I can still learn a whole lot from how he approach as it makes things sounds better.

I totally agree that this reading was really great because it wasn't filled with a ton of facts and statistics.  It was truly refreshing to hear a new point of view that seemed quite genuine and well informed.  It was also engaging because it didn't feel like it was turned out of a scientific paper but instead actually from the perspective of a person trying to limit their impacts on the environment.  All of the quotes that you used in your response truly resonated with me and stood out in the article as a whole.  I have to say one of my favorite quotes is the one talking about how there's a place called "Away" in our industrial mindsets.  Before reading these chapters and your response, I never really thought about the consequences of the things that I throw away.  Similar to your situation, I also struggle with the idea of recycling and throwing things away.  It's difficult to throw anything away, especially plastic, knowing that in some way it will negatively affect the environment.  However, I believe it is better to battle with your conscious than to completely be unaware of the consequences of your actions.  Everything we purchase and throw away really are connected in some way shape or form.  I totally agree with your perspective on finding the reading motivating and inspiring because it really helps to consolidate the issue of wastefulness and the negative effects it poses on the environment.  Because of this, I hope to also read all of the material once I have more time on my hands.

The first part of your comment immediately gained my interest. I really liked how you tied in the idea that a bunch of facts and statistics often turn people off and can make people lose interest in the article, or whatever it may be, they are reading. I would also like to say that the quote you chose was very interesting it captured my interest as well during my reading and I too agree heavily with its contents. This reading was really refreshing because it allows for personal input and exploration into what each individual actually believes. I am not saying that the other readings we have done in this class are not representative of what needs to be done in regard to the climate change, but it was very nice to have this new style of reading that focuses more on as you stated "self and mindfulness". I really enjoyed reading your comment the language in which you used to describe why you liked this reading is the main reason I chose to reply to this comment specifically. The reading was in my opinion the most inspiring as well because sometimes when I am reading about all of the facts that were are presented it is quite overwhelming. I think if people are to learn about the climate change it is best to have some readings like this thrown in the mix so that people do not lose hope and that they can feel like they still have some control over what is currently happening. This will help boost morale and it will create a better environment to improve our situation.



<br><Hr>

I totally agree with you! I myself am not a science person, so for me an overabundance of statistics generally makes readings seem very dense and hard-to-follow. Kalmus’ writing style on the other hand was very engaging, and drummed up a more personal, emotional response while reading. This reminded me of reading Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring in English 22 last year; she was not a scientist, but an author, so while she did present a scientific argument, she did it from a humanistic perspective. That’s also the approach Ken uses is teaching both classes, which I really appreciate as, again, I’m not a science person, but this issue is still very important to me and I’m glad to have the opportunity to learn about it in a way that I can understand.
  <br><br>


I think it’s interesting that you mention the effectiveness of this approach with “the Uncle Pete type of people,” as you say, as well. For some reason this is true. As I’ve learned in this class about the personal changes we can make to decrease our carbon footprints, I’ve become increasingly confused by the fact that my dad, who vehemently denies the science of climate change, has been implementing these strategies for as long as I can remember. He has a compost bin which he uses to fertilize his garden and grow some of his own food, doesn’t own a dryer and instead dries all his laundry on a clothesline, always tries to repurpose things before throwing them out, and he meticulously checking the resin identification codes on plastics/recyclables. He does all this and yet, he doesn’t believe that climate change is real and will very heatedly argue against it. To me this is extremely confusing, but I suppose it’s still positive that he’s making the changes even if he doesn’t yet see why they’re so important.

Reading “Being the Change” by Peter Kalmus gave me some elucidation for the certain way of thinking of  “If not everyone does it then what is the point.” And its just not that simple. Collective action is what really does make a difference, though we each have to do our part in the long battle. As the saying goes “A chain is only as strong as its weakest link”. Put that into terms of people here in the U.S who actively try to reduce their carbon footprint and those who don’t. Our “chain” as a country is weak.



</p><hr>


<p>

One thing that made the chapters I read from "Be the Change" stick out more than the readings we have done so far in the course was Kalmus's regular use of graphs and pie charts to explain his data more clearly. After a while, I find myself becoming numb to listed statistics regarding carbon emissions, but I think Kalmus's method of both writing and visually illustrating his findings of the personal changes he made was very helpful. I was intrigued by the charts and graphs that occurred often because they reinforced the ideas that I may have unconsciously skimmed over in the actual paragraphs. Kalmus's obvious passion for living a uber-sustainable life was demonstrated well in words, while the more scientific information I think was better spelled out in the form of visual aids. I think that's why in the chapter regarding collective action, it felt more mundane to read because that section involved less statistical data and more abstract ideas to reduce greenhouse gas emissions on a larger scale.
  <br><br>


I think people like Kalmus, esteemed scholars that is, play a huge role in influencing the general public to change their lifestyles in favor of limited GHG emissions. Although Kalmus may not be a professor, many people in the postsecondary educational system teach the work that he has done to students who need to be informed about what they can do to fight the climate crisis. As silly as it sounds, I think if teachers and professors can make it a trend to communicate the significance of climate change, rising generations will set the standard in implementing ideas like renewable energy and mass transit on a nationwide scale. I believe that if individual people can first adopt practices in favor of Earth, activism will follow that will result in the creation of policies that all people will have to follow by law.



</p><hr>


<p>
Peter Kalmus shows me how personal actions contribute to the protection of environment. I am used to be the kind of person that see no value in personal reductions, as what Kalmus mentions. However, his experience of becoming a vegetarian and reducing his CO2 emissions inspire me a lot. Kalmus points out that personal reduction can not only make people enjoy the life of connecting with the nature, but “shifting the culture and helping others envision change”. It is true that directly reducing global emissions cannot be done by personal actions, but it’s possible to save the world by collective actions.
   <br><br>

In the chapter “Collective Actions”. Like other articles we read have mentioned, Kalmus points out that carbon fees and dividend is a great approach to reduce the burning of fossil fuel. He specifies the price of CO2 per tonne and assumes that the fees added to the price of gas can be given back to citizens as a dividend by check. This solution sounds reasonable to me, and it is more like an investment.
   <br><br>

Overall, I admire Peter Kalmus’s lifestyle and his efforts to reduce his carbon footprint from 23 metric tonnes of CO2-equivalents to approximately 2.1 tonnes CO2-equivalents. As he can achieve this goals, we can reduce our greenhouse emissions to this amount as well. His personal actions will finally lead to the achievement of collective actions.

Hi there thank you for sharing and I totally agree with your comment! Kalmus's book and the documentary really goes a long way to show the impacts of personal actions on the environment and that we as individuals can make a difference and contribute to the overall large cause of the climate crisis. Many would have doubts about the effectiveness of personal actions in addressing climate change by arguing that personal actions are way too meager to solve climate change and individuals cannot do much to help save our environment because their actions would not make much of a difference. However, they forget that one individual action might not make a difference, but what if this one individual spreads the word and raises awareness on climate change in the community and now everyone in the community is taking personal actions? This collective momentum is what we need to mitigate the climate crisis because together we can make a difference in our environment and change our lifestyles for the benefit of us humans. I also want to bring up what Kalmus said in his book on the positive changes that occurred in his life after he took steps to reduce his carbon footprint by not flying, biking to work and many more. Kalmus stated that even if climate change disappeared someday under some kind of magic spell, then he would continue the same lifestyle because this low-carbon lifestyle allows him to connect and spend more quality time with his family and the local community which he was not able to do before with a high-carbon life. By choosing not to fly and commute by biking, Kalmus does not need to fly to conferences or committees to discuss environmental findings which is ironic because he is an environmentalist yet he still flies and flying is the quickest way to warm our planet. This way he can spend more time with his family, friends, and community, and he could never do this without deciding to abandon flying in the first place. All in all, the Kalmus family's story shows us different ways we can reduce our carbon footprint in our daily lives and that the mission of mitigating climate crisis ought to start with our everyday tasks.


<br><Hr>
Kalmus' actions to reduce his carbon footprint inspired me as well. I'm not really used to focusing on personal actions and seeing them as a major change, but seeing how mich him alone could reduce his carbon emissions was really nice to see. Instead creating a change to our lives, Kalmus emphasizes us rather changing our lifestyles as a whole, and as a benefit we could connect with and enjoy nature more. This can help us become more peaceful and less reliant on our materialistic culture and mindset that we have today. If we all contribute to this cause, even if it is only in small amounts, we can create a large collective change and have a more significant impact on the earth. Kalmus' experiment proves that it is definitely possible to change our lifestyles to live more like minimalists while still leading a happy and meaningful life. I hope that his actions can not only prove to people that it is possible to lead a minimalist lifestyle but also inspire people to lead this type of life as well and eventually stop the climate crisis.

One thing that I found most interesting about all his reductions, and one that Ken brought up, was the use of a clothesline. As someone whose family back home continues to use a clothesline I always thought it was normal growing up. While we do own a dryer it is only used if something needs to be dried super quickly. Otherwise all our clothes are put on the clothesline in the backyard to dry. However, I realize not everyone has that option. I grew up in the Central Valley of California where it is sunny almost everyday. People who grow up in places with colder weather cannot have this option. 
  <br><br>

Another thing that continues to bother me about the lifestyle Peter Kalmus lives is that no matter how much it is advertised that everyone can live the way he does the honest truth is that not everyone can. He was a researcher who flew around the world presenting his work now he does it mostly from the comfort of the internet. However, so much of the population works jobs where they cannot do it by simply popping open their laptops. These people have to drive to their jobs no matter what. Yet on the other hand I agree that even people working these types of jobs could make an effort by carpooling, etc. As someone who sees both sides of the situation it is easy to understand why people don’t like the romanticization of Peter Kalmus’ lifestyle.

After reading the articles of this week and watching Ken’s lecture video introducing Peter Kalmus, I feel more optimistic about what we are doing to benefit the climate. I have been wondering whether what I did, including eating a plant-based diet and biking to school, is helping at all. Because these things seem to be so small that I cannot even see the outcome of my effort. I believe a lot of people are also worrying that their effort might not pay off. However, Peter Kalmus, as a scientist and an environmentalist, is capable of calculating the result as well as keeping an eco-friendly lifestyle. Fortunately, the result is significant and much more than I expected. Now I am more confident that I should continue doing these things and keeping these habits. In Peter’s calculation, one year of green lifestyle can reduce 0.4 metric tons of carbon emission each person, which means every five people per year saves the carbon emission of producing a car. 
  <br><br>
Furthermore, there are lots of people still hesitating about whether they should be an environmentalist and change their lifestyle to protect the environment because they are not sure if doing so really helps. I can now persuade these people to start their actions using Peter’s experience and calculations.

I have had very similar hesitations about whether or not my efforts actually make a difference. I am fearful for our future, however, this reading assuaged my doubts some. I know that I trying to cut back on my carbon footprint by eating a mainly plant-based diet, by carpooling, and by turning off electricity when I am not using it. I am thankful for the clarification about the reality of his life rather than what was just portrayed in the film. It was exciting to see how he was humbled and satisfied by reducing his own emissions. I am inspired to make a difference, even though I am not an "environmentalist".

Honestly I’m really glad that we were assigned this reading from Peter Kalmus because it was really refreshing to hear more of his perspective and reasoning behind his new lifestyle versus how it was portrayed in his film. I completely misjudged him when I thought he was too spiritual in his film, but I appreciated how he acknowledges how people don’t really respond to facts and that it’s his responsibility not just as a scientist, but as a human to communicate these things to the public. 
  <br><br>

I found the chapter about collective action to be really interesting. I was surprised about how much economic background he had and how he was able to apply it to the reasoning of so many ideas. I love the quote from him “Global warming is a market failure” because the right-side of politics only wants change that doesn’t involve more governmental regulation and only seems to care about the free market. I had no idea there was a difference in a tax and a fee and it goes to show the amount of misinformation or lack thereof is out there from the media that tries to smear these solutions without even providing the public with correct information for them to synthesize themselves. In addition, showing examples from other places like British Columbia and their success for a carbon fee goes to show that some of the ideas that people like Bernie Sanders are proposing are not radical at all. 
  <br><br>

Overall, I really enjoyed the economic cost-benefit analyses he provided for a carbon fee and other economic solutions that really would not infringe with the free market the right side tries so hard to protect for some reason.

These two readings have really opened my eyes on the issue of ditching fossils and transitioning to renewable energy. We get to learn the inspiring stories of people pioneering change in their own lives and in their communities in order to live in a sustainable and regenerative way. Learning these stories shows me that there is hope, and if we want a sustainable future, then everyone has to do their part. If we want any hope of a sustainable future, we need to leave 80% of the fossil fuels that we are aware about in the ground for at least a century. I am extremely doubtful that this would actually happen considering how money hungry big corporations are.
  <br><br>

 What I learned from these readings is  that most issues stem from economics. We keep wanting more, and these unsustainable growths cannot be met by the natural resources available to us. “The reunion we long for drives consumerism, greed, neurotic behavior to replace those missing relationships.” Instead of focusing on material goods, we need to focus more on our relationships. I think that many of the solutions suggested are easily doable. I was skeptical at first when one solution suggested was composting our own waste but it made sense afterwards. If we are composting our own waste, then we become more aware of what we are putting in our bodies, contributing to eating healthier and better waste. We cannot make a change without collective action. Its is our duty as a planet to unite and fight for a better future.

In addition to the documentary on Kalmus's lifestyle we saw last week, reading about how and why Kalmus took drastic measures to reduce his climate footprint and analyzing all the numbers and graphs that he presented in chapters 9 of his book "Being the Change" added another lens through which I and other readers can see just how much our daily actions and behaviors significantly impact the climate crisis and that understanding which actions have the most impact is the first step towards initiating a positive change for the environment. I feel good knowing that I don't contribute to CO2 emissions from flying and driving, but Kalmus's breakdown of the impact food and waste production reveals that there's much more I can personally do to reduce my climate impact. 
  <br><br>

The chapter on collective action was both unexpected and convincing for me. I didn't expect a climate scientist to delve so deep into the political and economic ramifications of policies like carbon taxes/fees and cap-and-trade. Kalmus's advocacy for a carbon fee and dividend (CFAD) system is quite persuasive as he thoroughly argues the viability and benefits of CFAD with solid empirical and numerical evidence. I do think that some of the ideas towards the end of the chapter can be dismissed as wishful thinking, but his holistic yet pragmatic perspective on fighting the climate crisis has certainly made a lasting impact on how I think about the future of our planet.

<p>
"Leaving Fossil fuels" was a very interesting chapter to read because it lays out facts and statistics which I didn't even know about before. It's good to have a scientific perspective on these things so that I'm more aware about the numbers. It's really hard to make lifestyle changes, regardless of how little, because once we get accustomed to things or get caught in a routine, it's just hard to step out of it. But I'm really trying to actively make changes in my diet and shopping to be more environmentally friendly. Personal reductions make such a big difference, and I'm glad that Kalmus talked about that. Even just one person can make a difference in our culture and how we do things. We should try to all make personal changes in order to achieve a better climate situation. Personally, I'm trying to cut down on meat and it's been a little bit hard but it's easier to do it little by little.




</p><hr>


<p>Even though we watched the corresponding documentary last week, I liked this week’s readings because it went into more detail and layed out how the ideas stated in the film were actions and not just ideas. The specific charts, graphs, and statistics really resonated with me being a numbers person, so I think the reading was more effective than the film. Him showing the formulas of how to calculate your own personal emission levels and then giving the recipes to reduce is something that everyone should take a look at.
   <br><br>

Many of the ways he reduced his carbon footprint were the same ones Ken suggested a few lectures ago - flying, driving, stuff, food, etc. Those clearly are the most important when mitigating the climate crisis, but this reading seemed to give extra incentives to change those. Biking instead of driving made him happier, buying less stuff saved him money, eating a climatarian diet made him healthier, and avoiding travel by plane assured he wasn’t a hypocrite. I see an issue with people who claim to be climate activists but still fly all the time… if you are going to fly, then fine, but don’t act like the majority of your emissions aren’t from something totally in your control like flying. 
   <br><br>

Although I found chapter 9 much more interesting, chapter 14 was very important to include because it addresses the relationship between climate change and the economy, which seems to be the big issue with many people. Having the money taxed go straight back to the public seems like a great way to discourage emissions but not make the public hurt financially because of it. Redistributing the wealth is what we need at a time like now and if we can do that in a way that is saving our planet, I see it as a win win.

<p>

Of the two chapters from Peter Kalmus’s Being the Change, the one that stuck with me the most was the one titled “Collective Action.” I was not fully informed on what carbon fees were until Kalmus quite through explained how and why they work in terms of reducing carbon emissions, and it left me pondering the divide in our country that results in profound disagreement and temporary solutions to a global-scale issue. Kalmus reiterates what Ken has been emphasizing the past few weeks: we need a complete reconstruction of our social structure, our values, and our physical lifestyles to accomplish large enough change. 

  <br><br>

My absolute favorite part of this chapter was when Kalmus wrote about the eight- through nineteen-year-olds who challenged the U.S. government in court on the “constitutional obligation to protect the atmosphere for future generations.” I think that this moving image of young generations taking the future into their own hands when preceding generations refused to do so perfectly captures the reasons we are fighting for the protection of our earth. Without the foreseeable future of a healthy planet or a viable alternative, the generations that follow will continue to face worsening social equity and environmental disasters before their very eyes.

After reading "be the change," I learned that one must fight through the hardships that society brings onto that individual and still become the change that the world needs. For example, in America, there are many politicians who manipulate their audience about ignoring and discrediting the validity about climate change and the necessity to improve the environment. However, one must fight past that manipulation and set back in order to promote climate change and etc. People must come together to support this idea. Also I realized how lucky I am to be a part of this community at this school because I learned a lot from this class and became inspired to become part of this change. I hope other people and students in this class, school, and other places across the world can feel this way.

When reading "Being the Change" I found the following quote very interesting: "If there’s one thing that humans ought to agree on, it’s that breathing clean air is a good thing. Even those who don’t care about global warming would not regret a carbon fee. Globally, air pollution from burning fossil fuels causes millions of deaths and costs trillions of dollars per year.26 In the US alone, 200,000 people per year die prematurely from air pollution, mainly from road transportation and power generation.27 CFAD would gradually fix this devastating problem, with no economic down side. Nations like India with severe air pollution could use CFAD to drive their transitions from dirty energy to renewables."  I think it is very obvious that breathing clean air is a good thing.  I was very confused on why that statement was made since i believe it is common knowledge that breathing clean air is a positive thing.  What I did not know was that 200,000 people die because of air pollution.  If it was not obvious enough before the matter I think something should be done and more people should actually take action in decreasing the air pollution.  Some causes of this are:  factories, cars, and mainly the burning of fossil fuels.  Companies know this but they do not care and continue to pollute the air killing lives.  The burning of fossil fuels should be completely abolished, for obvious reasons.  But the only problem is that there are so many ignorant people.

I believe that although the reading uses a lot of statistics, it is rationally connected to common sense. Like you mentioned "breathing clean air is a good thing" it seems like something everyone would agree with, but the fact is that there are so many cities with pollution as thick as smog, yet no one bats an eye. This leads me to believe that many don't believe in that principle. There are so many climate change deniers that have visual proof of our dire situation, yet choose to ignore what's in front of their faces.

In "Being the Change," Peter Kalmus explains the way he reduced his own carbon footprint while explaining the implications. The list of the ways he reduced his carbon footprint include flying less and choosing other alternatives such as slow travel. In reading this, I think about my own dreams to travel the world. These are dreams that I grew up having as a child that continue to be part of who I am today. Yet, while reading the chapter on “Leaving Fossil Fuel,” the other readings, films and the lecture videos, much of what I want changes for me. While traveling is still part of my ideal future, slow travel offers more connections to the world and to people. Slow travel also changes the way we can travel by making it more about the journey compared to planes, while also helping to mitigate the climate crisis.
  <br><br>

Another point that continues to stick out to me is Peter Kalmus ending statement in the chapter “Collective Action.” He states, "When I feel unsure about whether or not I should speak out, I think of the billions of people with no voice on the matter. I think of those who are most vulnerable. I think of my children. And then the decision to speak out is easy." I find this comment to have profound meaning when it comes to the climate crisis. When we contemplate the climate crisis and what the future will possibly be like, the people we love and those who are being impacted by it everyday come to mind. Moreover, by reading this comment, I value the importance of having a motive. When we truly embrace what matters to us and our "why," we are inspired to make a difference. This motive includes our family, future generations, or other people who are most impacted by the climate crisis. I believe that it is important to find something that we truly care about and use that as a tool or as our map for action. What if we truly step back and ask, "why we are learning about the crisis, and how can we take what we care about and use it as a tool to implement real change?"

When I am watching the “being the change” what I feel is just my lifestyle at UCSB. I am glad that though we are all well and have nearly little influence on the whole world. But as there are a lot of international students at UCSB. The global impact will help the earth to develop in a positive way in the future. Just like me, though I have the opportunity to drive to school every day. But I choose to ride my bicycle to school on weekdays. Same as a lot of UCSB students, we are riding bikes and skateboard to class a lot. By doing so, we will be the change to influence or recovery the environment.

Hey Freda, going along with your comment, I feel the same way about how I get to class. However, I realize, I personally fall short on doing these types of things when I'm back home in LA. After reading, Peter  Kalmus's, "Being the Change" I tried to put what I do at home into more perspective and I started to question how much I really am helping out the environment. Reading Kalmus's approach to his own life and translating it over for climate activism has made me do the same. The graphs and charts in the reading I think really helped display just how much one individual can do. For me, this reading has helped inspire me to keep closer track of what I do day to day, not just at school and how this impacts Earth. I hope it has done the same, and by your comment I think it has.

Though I liked the documentary we watched last time from Peter Kalmus, I also really enjoyed reading these two chapters from his book. “Leaving fossil fuel” had Peter telling us that if it was possible for his family to significantly decrease their emissions, then it’s possible for the rest of us. The graphics that he included in this chapter were also very interesting, as it was astonishing to see how much of his personal footprint came just from traveling via flying. I enjoyed how he broke down each category from his footprint and explained how he was able to reduce from it, such as taking an 100% renewable option for electricity and growing his own food as well and trading extra with neighbors.

  <br><br>

 I also liked reading the “Collective Action” chapter, and found myself agreeing with Peter that citizens must demand a carbon tax in order to prevent further damage to our planet. Overall, these two excerpts were very thought-provoking and once again, I found myself thinking of ways I could reduce my footprint bit by bit.

There are a few things noted in “Being the Change” by Peter Kalmus that interest me. I’ve seen huge jars of natural gases in the suburban area of my hometown, where the main industries work for the city reside. I was told that natural gas, with the name of “natural,” is far more environmentally friendly than coal energy. The government is still publicizing the use of natural gases instead of coal energy to the lagging countryside. But the use of natural gas emits methane, and the leakage of methane is even worse than that of coal. Another point that I have no idea before is the method of composting. This is a good point and worthy of trials. Ken is right that Being the Change and Project Drawdown together provide general as well as specific and personal approaches to deal with climate change. I’m also attracted by his high expectation on CFAD, which seems like a feasible societal approach for this issue aside from voluntary individual actions.



</p><hr>


<p>
I liked how in "Being the Change", Pater Kalmus focused on the individual things we could be doing to alleviate the climate crisis, because it gives me hope that even though corporations in the oil, meat, and fast fashion industries are collectively destroying our planet, we as individuals can do our parts in living sustainably and being conscious consumers. Reducing our consumption of energy by going solar, reducing food waste through composting, boycotting the fast fashion industry in favor of long-lasting and ethically-made products, and choosing a plant-based diet are all achievable and beneficial lifestyle changes that not only will combat the climate crisis, but will help us in leading healthier and more fulfilling lives. I also completely agree with the cognitive dissonance aspect that Kalmus touches upon. We are all knowingly depleting our planet of its resources; even if you’ve been a vegan for your entire life and use public transportation every day, one plane flight to Paris will erase all of the progress you have made in a year. The burning of fossil fuels every day in society destroys the actions individuals take to reduce their carbon footprints. Peter is right in saying it’s “better to align action to principle” on an individual level, but we also need to hold those large conglomerates accountable for the destruction they are causing each day. This is where collective action on a large scale comes in; introducing a carbon tax would be a large step forward in the right direction, as it would both lower overall carbon emissions and benefit the economy. We also need to stop allowing the government to subsidize fossil fuel projects. It is frustrating to me that corrupt politicians only care about their own wealth and will accept bribes from the fossil fuel industry at the expense of our planet and human lives. Standing up to the fossil fuel industry, exposing the greedy politicians that work against the planet’s interests, and imposing strict new campaign finance laws that will get money out of politics is imperative if we want to move towards sustainable energy and reduce our emissions.

For this week’s reading “Being the Change,” I can found more reasons for me to make personal change for the Earth. Also, the reason why I love this reading so much is that instead of just stating the facts which is the severity of climate change, it also include the statistics, and these make the climate change more vividly. Moreover, we should be knowledgeable to make changes to our lifestyles. For example, we need to think what part of our lifestyles contribute most damage to our Earth, For me, the greatest part is traveling. I have taken planes for many times, and from now on, I need to take trains or stop traveling, because now I realize that how harmful it is to Earth. Lastly, we need to accept and spreading what scientists reported, because that’s the truth. If we continue ignore the fact concluded by thousands of trials, the doom will be close to us.

Similar to you, I also feel like this reading got to me on a personal level. I appreciated all the statistical information because it really puts things into perspective, I feel more knowledgable knowing exact information such as how electricity and food contribute to CO2 emissions, as opposed to just a general comment about how CO2 emissions are increasing. I can also see what categories I fall into in regards to how much CO2 I emit, and I can try and cut back. For you, it's planes, but for me I don't ride planes very much, instead I would probably say my consumption of meat is the main thing I would really need to work on cutting back on. Being in this class has convinced me more and more that if everyone were to start making changes in their own lifestyle, it can add up and the results would be very beneficial. There are so many examples of people we have studied in this class that have greatly reduced their carbon footprint, imagine if everyone could do the same.

<p>
After reading the two chapters from the book“Being the change,” I feel it is so true that the reading seems more specific and more focus on the personal life. Kalmus keeps mentioning how he reduced his CO2 emissions by showing a list of dataset. It is really impressive to see how much work he did in order to reach this point. One thing I noticed amazing is the comparison in the Figure 9.2. After he decided not to fly anymore, his CO2 emission reduced significantly immediately. Even though he also reduced emissions from other aspects such as food, driving, waste, etc, the sum of all of these other reductions is far less than the contribution of no flying. 
  <br><br>
I, like many others, believe that individual action is not enough to influence the climate crisis greatly; on the other hand, Kalmus provides so much evidence and suggestions that it is so hard to not believe and ignore. The mainly way we can make individuals being engaged with the change is simply to be the change immediately and constantly. I respect his activities and believe that we need more people to be the change from every part of their day by day lives. Also, I was really enjoyed reading this book because the reading can help me estimate my own emissions as well.

I also got discouraged over the course of the class about how effective individual action can be in the greater scheme of climate activism. But, Peter's writing (which I think was more eye opening than the documentary from last week) demonstrates how individual action can be effective and points out second and third order effects that go beyond one's own GHG emissions. He does a good job explaining how he went from 10 tons (in 2012) to 2.1 tons (in 2014) of GHG emissions and also how other people who maybe do not have access to time and resources like Peter can still make effective changes in one's lifestyle to cut GHG emissions substantially. 
  <br><br>
The most interesting part of this week's read to me however what the concept of the Carbon Fee (not tax). I feel that this would be a viable catalyst for furthering our individual actions, as it would serve as a type of reward to get us to an alternative lifestyle with climate change in mind. I think individual action can definitely get enough people there to make carbon fees approved and the consequences of that would hopefully make more people invest in individual action.

Leaving Fossil Fuel
  <br><br>

The fact that Peter Kalmus has reduced his carbon emissions by more than a factor of ten is incredible and inspiring. In the reading he says that he still emits nearly twice the average Bangladeshi, and that is a fact that is difficult to believe. Hiltner adds to this by saying the average American citizen’s trash sitting in a landfill has more of a carbon footprint annually than the average Bangladeshi. This is a statistic that is hard to grasp as well. In chapter 9: Leaving Fossil Fuel, he talks about how quantifying his carbon footprint was a necessary step towards reducing his carbon footprint. Once he knew these percentages, he became much more aware of what he is doing, and how his actions are affecting others. I felt the same reaction to learning the numbers of an individual’s carbon footprint in this class. As soon as we were taught these percentages, I instantly became more aware of what I was doing and eating everyday, and the impact of those actions. There was a quote from the reading that caught my attention: “By changing ourselves, we help others envision change. We gradually shift cultural norms.” This reminded me of Gandhi’s quote “Be the change you want to see in the world”.
  <br><br>

Collective action
  <br><br>

In this chapter, Kalmus provides a statistic that added to my hopelessness for humanity’s ability to save the Earth. He explained that in 1997, the words developed nations, excluding the United States, India, and China, agreed to reduce their greenhouse has emissions by 5% less than the 1990 levels by the year 2012. No one took the agreement seriously, and by 2013, global emissions were 60% higher than 1990 levels. This fact didn’t necessarily shock me, as I don’t envision the world coming together to stop this as one human race. I would love if this happened, but I think people are too stuck in their ways to change this drastically in the short amount of time we need this to happen in. With the idea of carbon emissions, I like the idea. However, I’m not sure if it will work, and would once again love to see it in action to see if it works.

This week's reading, Leaving Fossil Fuel, discusses how our society is dependent on fossil fuel and how this interdependency is creating a toxic environment for all living orgasms. It then goes on to propose alternative energy sources other than fossil fuel that is both environmentally conscious and self-sustainable. Some of the propositions are swapping traditional mode of transportation like a car for a bicycle because the manufacturing, maintenance and the act of driving a car produce a large portion of the average person’s greenhouse gas footprint. Then changing to a plant-based diet to eliminate the contribution of methane into the atmosphere by the livestock septum. Another highlight in the plan in minimizing greenhouse gases by an individual is limit or stop traveling through means of airplanes because air travel emits carbon dioxide directly to the biosphere which furthermore warms and worsens the climate crisis significantly. These solutions are not groundbreaking because throughout the course we have discussed these possible solutions, however, what I can appreciate and admire is the fact that Peter Kalmus (the writer) has implemented these practices as the fundamental bases on how he and his family (wife and two children) live their lives. Most of the time, it seems like the people who talk about climate change and the human actions driving the climate crisis are themselves also part of this mass trend of destruction. So seeing how Peter lives his life is rather refreshing and inspiring, to say the least. To further more reinforce his proportions, he provides factual proof about the reduction of greenhouse gases by his part. He states that he has reduced his greenhouse gas emission by a factor of ten; nonetheless, he does confess that although he has reduced his greenhouse emissions by a large margin he still emits more than the average person living in Bangladeshi. In all, the transparency in his writing and commitment to the cause is the core reason why people in his community have also implemented his practices into their own lives and continue to spread the word. 
   <br><br>
The second reading, Collective Action, furthermore adds on to the idea that as individuals in society, we should take the initiative in saving our community that can be done by implementing policies enforcing a common ground for all. One of several policies he proposes is the carbon tax. By putting a price on the emission of carbon will equally put everyone to emit accountable for their actions and if they wish to emit carbon it will cost them more by every year. Another political alternative is Cap-and-trade which is meant to control the carbon emissions by trade companies that produce and trade product goods. But unlike the carbon tax, the cap-and-trade proposition comes with a lot of problems and loopholes that questions the success of the policy in the long term. In general, there are a lot of policies that might help or may not depending on the goal trying to be achieved by implementing it. 
   <br><br>
In all, there has to be cultural change as well as policy implementation in order to combat the progression of climate change.

While reading "Being the Change", I began to notice a trend in the way Peter Kalmus structured his chapter on "Leaving Fossil Fuel". He first introduces the issue at hand, like emotions from vehicular travel: cars, trains, and buses. Then e goes on further to calculate how much Carbon emissions they release, to what he finally recommends is the best option based on his own experience and scientific knowledge. I find this methodology very effective in pursuing the reduction of CO2e (carbon emissions). It not only lay's down the facts, but it also shows the experience of a person's (Kalmus's) attempt to do these solutions that were are given. There were even times in the chapter--like when he opted not to put rooftop solar panels--that surprised me because in his experience, the solution would not be effective for him but maybe for others--that is, if you're in a 11,000 kWh P/Y house hold. Not all the solutions he lays our for himself are effective, yet he still does the calculations and even tests them for us (like decomposing clothing). He's like our test dummy! This isn't another "I can do it so can you" story, but rather a more complex and practical way of introduce people into his lifestyle and one we can adapt ourselves into.

<p>

In reading "Being The Change" by Peter Kalmus, I felt empowered by Kalmus' individual action. His book was a really cool way to look into his personal life and how personal action can lead to community change. This reminds me of Ken's lecture about being an architect of the future. Again, I found it difficult to make certain changes that Kalmus made. Being a vegetarian is easy on my own, but when I live with my parents, cultural factors make it harder not to eat meat. Additionally, quitting flying as Kalmus has is really difficult because I really value the bonds I have with my family that lives in Egypt, and the experiences we get when I visit them every few years. 
  <br><br>
I think his concept of quantification through knowing your own impact on the environment. Being aware of your actions and how they impact the environment around you is, as Kalmus says, is "...a prerequisite to changing them." I've tried to become more aware of what it means when I eat beef at home, or what driving to UCSB instead of taking the train up from home means, and I've noted that this makes me consider the ethics of my everyday actions more as I live. I also liked how Kalmus acknowledged that this was not just an individual journey, but one we need to make as a population through regulations and policy changes. Being the change doesn't mean that we have to undergo this journey entirely alone.

<p>

I would like to start keeping track of my carbon emissions and reduce it as he has. However, being a college student living in dorms, it is hard for me to keep track of my footprint when it comes to electricity and water usage. I feel that apps that keep track of carbon footprints would make it easier for so many people to keep track of it and be more environmentally conscious. However, when I tried to download an app, it didn’t seem as efficient as I had hoped. It also had many features that could only be used for pay. Knowing that almost every American has a phone, I feel that Apple should develop an app that is automatically downloaded such as health, files, or calculator, to help people track their footprint. I also think that this app could include a food tracker and can tell you what foods are in season. I feel that this would be an easy way for all Americans to make it easier, because many won’t spend hours of research to calculate their footprint. I understand that technology won’t completely solve the climate crisis, but I think that this could be a good step towards the right direction.
  <br><br>
I also liked the solution he had proposed about the carbon fee. Many people’s excuse for not eating healthy or at farmers markets is that it is too expensive. However, the carbon fee could encourage more Americans to shop healthier and eco-friendly. It would also increase the use of public transportation. I know that many of my family members would choose the cheaper route and spend more money on healthier choices if a carbon fee was in place. This would significantly lower the average carbon emissions. 
  <br><br>
However, these solutions will only work if everyone works as a community to make it happen. Making public transportation cleaner and safer would also increase their use. More vegetarian lunch options in schools would also drastically decrease emissions. More education in schools about the climate crisis would also drastically lower the carbon footprint, as many of the newer generation would be likely to change their habits. Hopefully, through all this change, America as a country can collectively take action and encourage other countries to do the same.

I am just amazed at how Kalmus was able to change his life around and reduce his climate footprint drastically. Like others, I am extremely fascinated by how he was able to change his car from using oil to running mostly on vegetable oil. How is that even possible? This just goes to show the ways we can be innovative about how we can change come up with solutions to solve this issue. 
  <br><br>


Going freegan and vegetarian I find also to be remarkable because I know it is not easy to do the switch. Even his entire family striving to do better for the better is especially incredible and should be noticed. Imagine if more families were to look to him as an example and did the same. Emissions would drop for sure and we would be on the right track to healing our planet. I think some people have to see others do something before they are willing to do it because it shows that it is indeed possible. I would like my family to be more conscious of the actions that they do to care for the planet because it has to start somewhere. I would not force my beliefs down their throats of course because that would only scare them. I can only lead as an example and hope they would follow when they want too.

After reading “Leaving Fossil Fuel” and “Collective Action” I feel very informed on ways I can change my personal climate change impact. Many people sadly believe that their personal change will not create any difference and is why many people see no need to change their actions or lifestyle. However, if everyone began to make changes in their lives to become more environmentally friendly, we could see a global cultural shift. Many people are unaware that air travel and car travel use large amounts of their carbon footprints. According to “Leaving fossil fuels” the average American releases “1,000 kg of C02 per year from flying” and “5,000 kg of CO2 per year from driving”. The lack of education on fossil fuels and their devastating effects is a huge contributor to why people have not changed their lifestyles. I was shocked when I read that food is another huge contributor to carbon emissions. I never gave it much thought that it requires a lot of resources and traveling in order to reach the grocery store or restaurant where I would consume it. The people of Earth need to switch from fossil fuels to clean forms of energy such as wind or solar. The switch to these forms of energy can offer many benefits such as new jobs, markets, investments, and cleaner earth. Not only will there be beneficial economic effects, but they will help mitigate the climate crisis as a whole possibly.

I agree that many people will not change to action with less detrimental effect on the climate as they believe their ripples in the pond are insignificant, but people must become more educated as you mention to realize that when people just start changing it motivates others to change as well so that the world at large actually will see a difference. When people are educated, they will drive less and fly less and reduce all the carbon they would have emitted otherwise. Food is certainly a huge contributor to carbon emissions, not only in the production but the transportation. I think Peter said in his movie that 40% of the food produced in America daily goes to waste, which means that with the proper programs people would no longer have to be food insecure and there could be less waste and emissions. People must switch to cleaner alternative methods of energy, and create new jobs in the process. We must find a way as you say to mitigate economic and climate consequences at the same time, which I believe is very possible.

I really enjoyed this week’s reading and it was largely due to Kalmus relating to his readers on a personal level. In addition to including countless statistics to back his argument, Calmus talks about his own steps that he himself made to reduce his carbon footprint. We have already disscussed many of the steps that Kalmus made in 2012, including reducing air-travel and shifting over to a plant-based diet, but the intentionality of Kalmus was really inspiring to me personally. As Ken reiterated during at the end of this video, many of us can not make such drastic changes to our lives currently because of our living circumstances as full time students. However, the self-awareness required of Kalmus to take a deep dive into his daily life and to make the appropriate changes to reduce his footprint on a daily level is really inspiring. We make an impact on our environment daily. While it might not seem like a lot, they build up. By making changes, even simple ones, in our daily lives we can start to collectively bring change. I, for example, hung up a clothes line so I do not have to waste energy on drying my laundry when the sun can do just as good of a job.

This week’s reading of “Being the Change” by Peter Kalmus goes into greater detail of the inspiring journey that Peter is on in pursuit of lowering his total global greenhouse emissions. In the chapter titled “Leaving Fossil Fuels”, I found the charts included to be extremely impactful. As Peter was discussing how he gauged his total emissions and why he wanted to reduce his emissions, the graphs only helped to solidify his point. In specific, the figure that showed his reductions in circle proportions was the most impactful to me. A source of emissions that I didn’t think was all that harmful until taking this class was airplanes. From the many videos Ken’s done on it and that figure, it became much more obvious to me just how harmful flying is to our environment. It can contribute to such a large and completely unavoidable proportion of our carbon footprints. Especially for those with jobs that require lots of travel, such as academics. The figure that Peter included in his book showed just how large an impact flying had on his carbon footprint, and thus by choosing to quit using air travel, he was able to cut his footprint substantially. 
  <br><br>


This act of quitting planes was only one of the five most effective actions that he took to cut emissions. Peter also switched to a vegetarian diet, began bicycling more, took up a freegan lifestyle, and installed a system of composting in his backyard. All of these actions are things that the majority of us can easily do. Although, composting may be the most difficult act if you don’t have a backyard. Nonetheless, taking up these actions and many other sustainable actions can actually help save money in the long run. As Peter noted in his book, his family was able to cut down the amount spent on food to half of what it was before becoming vegetarians and adapting to a freegan lifestyle. As a broke college student, this is exactly the statistic I like to hear. They also spent less money on gas by relying on bikes or walking for a majority of their transportation needs. In total, every little change that Peter and his family adapted into their life helped them to save money and the environment all at once. 
  <br><br>

Although personal action is important, it’s obviously never going to be enough on its own to stop climate change. This thought is constantly in the back of my mind while reading/watching most of the material in this class and breeds most of my pessimism about the future of our environment. I feel like may of the changes that need to happen are just simply beyond my reach. For example, as an individual, I have essentially no power to stop fracking or tell people to stop driving or living in McMansions. In Peter’s book, he addresses this concern in the chapter “Collective Action”. He suggests a carbon fee that will resemble the actual cost, both environmental and market, of items made with the help of fossil fuels. This would force the price of many things to increase, which would eventually convince consumers to stop using those fossil fuel-dependent items. Not only would it warrant a loss of economic desirability, but it would also promote more investments in renewable sources of energy. Overall, I feel like a carbon fee has the potential to stimulate an abundance of needed change in our society. As Peter said, we have to stop encouraging fossil fuel dependence by allowing those items to remain unreflective of their true cost.

I agree that there is no way that personal action will solely solve or reduce the climate crisis. It does make me feel kind of powerless and like there is not any point to change habits, but that is thinking about it all wrong. I think many people believe that if "people power" cant solely solve an issue, then it's not worth changing an aspect of our life. We have to still implement these personal changes because that is where change starts!


<br><Hr>

I agree with you, especially on the fiscal desirability of switching over to a "green" lifestyle. Biking, taking public transportation, and walking are much cheaper options than owning a car, or even buying gas all the time to fill up a car's tank. Being vegetarian or vegan is much cheaper than buying meat, especially when we consider the massive amounts of subsidies given to the meat and dairy industries. Even growing a little herb garden can save someone money in the long run. And drying clothes on a clothesline is eco-friendly, easy, and much less expensive than the purchase and upkeep of a clothes dryer. It might even encourage us to buy less clothes in the first place, which is also a sustainability win. Like Kalmus wrote in his book, aligning our actions with our morals and beliefs is important, because it makes us feel better about ourselves.

  <br><br>

I also liked his practical solution of the carbon fee, which already exists in parts of Canada. It's no coincidence that we read the two chapters on personal financial issues and the economic solutions we can use to reduce our reliance on carbon. I would love to see the sort of institutional change that's needed in the U.S. to bring about a carbon fee that gives money back to the common person.

The last bit mentioned in the video was what I was feeling as I read Kalumus' writing. It felt like I was reading a fact sheet, but also someone's blog. It felt different because it was more personal despite being filled with statistics, and I could feel who Kalmus was from the writing just as much as from his documentary. Although the reading was filled with numbers, it felt more real because Kalmus was also narrating his experiences to us, showing that it's possible to make the change and the benefits from changing. The reading reminds me of the films we've been watching, but in written form, which was refreshing. I think Kalmus is a great communicator, since he conveys himself and his beliefs (which are backed up with evidence) through writing in a way that people can connect with.
  <br><br>

I really like some of his metaphors, such as, "You wouldn’t dream of leaving your water taps wide open when you’re not using them; I feel the same way about electricity. Electricity is precious." It's a shame that some people do leave their water taps open: I've seen people leave their lights on in the room when they're not there... for an entire day. I've also seen someone forget to turn the lights off and then spend an entire night at their friend's place. It's a shame that Kalmus didn't mention standby power. I learned about it in high school, but I feel like people would look at me weirdly if I crawled under my bed every night to unplug my computer.
  <br><br>

Another comparison I paid particular attention to was, "...our society has reached a point where even one person’s trash, taken by itself, generates more CO2e than the average Bangladeshi generates for everything." To me, this was one of the saddest (as in I want to groan) things I've heard in the class. To me, it feels like our trash is greater than a person. Then, that makes us multiple times greater than another person from a different country, which is truly a sign of inequality. If a person from another country can somehow be compared to our trash, then that's truly shameful. Sure, we joke and call each other pieces of trash, but there exists people who are somehow lesser than our trash. I know that CO2 emissions don't measure the worth of a person, but that fact that we can compare a person and trash seriously is truly sad. 
  <br><br>

I've always been a bit skeptical about paying carbon offsets because I can't directly see their positive effect on the environment. I never really felt that paying a few extra bucks would be enough to make up for the damage of flying or something. Kalmus' part on carbon offsets is something I really feel strongly about. When I asked someone to fly less, they said something along the lines of it being acceptable, though not great, because they pay a carbon offset. This exactly matches with Kalmus' last paragraph on carbon offsets: "Offsets allow people to assuage their guilt and continue flying. In other words, offsets may ultimately increase CO2 emissions." I really appreciate Kalmus explaining how carbon offsets work. It's a shame that something done with good intentions can unintentionally lead to further damage. Doing harm when thinking you're doing something good is one of the most painful things you can see someone do or experience yourself.
  <br><br>

I think carbon offsets aren't that great, but I think carbon taxes/fees would be effective, depending on how they're done. Instinctually, I feel that carbon taxes wouldn't be fun because they'd raise the prices of pretty much everything, so I've had mixed feelings about supporting a carbon tax. I'd like to support the environment, but still have enough to support my parents in the future, along with a possible small family. The idea of a fee is more interesting because it'd be a way of holding people responsible through an incentive. I just like the idea of being told to do something good for the environment in a way that doesn't feel forced. Also, since everyone would be doing it, I wouldn't feel pressured because everyone's doing it. Lastly, I learned in high school that cap-and-trade and quotas are generally a bad idea for the environment, so I'm surprised that people still want them, since limiting won't be enough anymore.

In the introductory paragraph of chapter 9, Peter states that "quantification allowed [him] to develop awareness of [his] daily actions, which was a prerequisite to changing them". I find this point to be very important. In order for individual efforts to reduce personal climate impact to be fruitful, it is important to focus on cutting down on the specific actions that leave the biggest carbon emissions for that person. This, as Peter states in the paragraph labeled "Your emissions profile will not look like mine", can be different for every to person depending on varying lifestyles. For Peter, this was airplane travel, but for others it could be meat consumption, day-to-day transportation,  etc. I believe this quantification exercise of listing out biggest source of personal climate impact can be very helpful to maximize your effort in reducing climate change.

  <br><br>

In chapter 14, the section labeled "Bipartisan Support" was intriguing to me. As stated, and as opposed to contrary belief, many conservatives actually DO want to take action on climatic change but want to do in a different way than liberals. Moving forward, especially with the next election, it is important for both parties to come to an agreement with a climate change plan that can be supported by the two sides. Although it is unfortunate that we have to make a compromise on such a chaotic problem, it is important to be realistic in our efforts to make some change at all.

After this week’s reading of the two chapters in “Being the Change” from Peter Kalmus, it was really interesting to see how he was able to analyze his own carbon footprint and recognize how it was lower than the average American. However, he didn’t stop there, he further reflected on how although he made drastic lifestyle changes, his individual carbon footprint was still greater than the average person in Bangladesh. Seeing how he put in all this effort into reducing his carbon footprint and still emit more carbon than people in other countries says a lot about privilege in the U.S.. Although we are not the top 1% in the U.S., we still emit more carbon than any average person in the world. Our actions are significantly impacting the world around us. However, our actions also do have the power to encourage change that can make a much more positive influence.
  <br><br>
This reading allowed me to realize how there are so many solutions to these first world problems. We are the ones causing climate change that is affecting those who have no part in the consequences of our actions. We must be the ones who initiate change because we have the power to influence other first worlds to do the same. Seeing how Peter was able to make personal changes to his life made me hopeful. In his reading, he also made a clear point as to how reducing people’s carbon footprint doesn’t necessarily mean that they have to change their lifestyle drastically. By allowing people to realize that, he is able to influence people to make a change that is more sustainable for our environment. We simply are trying to save this earth for us and for the lives on it. I simply don’t understand why people are so against it.

Reading about the ways that he changed his lifestyle in order to reduce his footprint also
  <br><br>
made me think about how there are so many different ways for each one of us to fight climate change.  People often think about how the actions of one person may not be significant at all.  However, as you said, our lifestyle changes may influence others to take action, who will then influence even more people.  By working together, we can begin to save our planet.

I really enjoyed the reading we had this week because of how guiding and informative that it was. The calculation guideline that was in the book was very good to visual information that was being talked about and allowing the information that would be easy to understand. The fact that Peter is trying to live a life that is through self-fulfillment rather than through outside influences adding to his gains, such as money, is a great way to show those who need guidance in life to be happy by thinking big picture. This book was very relatable because of how guilty I can feel knowing that I am damaging the one planet that we can live on. Him showing that impacts can be made gives me hope and a push to try and change my planet damaging habits. I personally enjoy readings that are more informative on a personal level, rather than continuously reading statistics that honestly I can relate to too much. Sure numbers are good to know, but to understand how someone feels during a process of changing their lifestyle and showing how it is doable is much more effective. We have to be willing to move from a place of routine and comfort to find it elsewhere. Otherwise we will never break habits that are damaging our planet.

After reading the two chapters from Peter Kalmus’s book, Being the Change, I felt like it was very well written. Although the second chapter we had to read was more difficult, I feel as though he got his point across and had all the numbers to back it up. I feel like his film is more influential because it was easier to see what he had done than read about it. The book is more geared towards those who want the evidence and numbers about how much it actually reduced his climate footprint. I think knowing how much the pilot lights were emitting was the most surprising fact in the whole two chapters I read. I mean 1.5 metric tons just coming from them? That’s crazy. But I think the most influential quote Peter had was “photons interacting with the atmosphere don't respond to our act of kindness, they only respond to our acts of greenhouse gas emissions.” This is important because it shows that we have to take action to make a difference. We need to cut back our emissions to be able to mitigate the climate crisis. It was also nice to have a balance of showing how he personally made a difference in his own life, and talking about how activism can make a greater difference. He showed us that we can always make changes in our lives but we should also strive to have more política activism and push the government for national changes. I don’t think I would recommend this book to anyone unless they’ve seen the movie and are more interested in Peter's changes. This also puts a big emphasis on political change and what each one would do. Comparing each change such as cap and trade, carbon tax, and carbon offsets helped me understand each of them more. This was a good intermediate read for those who already have some knowledge on the climate crisis.

When reading "Being the Change" by Peter Kalmus, I was very interested in his approach to be aware of the individuality of each person's task of reducing their carbon emissions. An important thing he points out and exemplifies with his own efforts is the need to quantify your emission reductions. This involves keeping track of things like how often you fly, drive, what food you are eating, and how much stuff you buy. I definitely agree that this kind of self-awareness is required to make effective action. There are two things Kalmus points out that stand out as viable solutions to the climate crisis in society's current state: freeganism and public transportation. These are two things that are so embedded into waste culture that solutions seem impossible. However, I believe increased funding for transports like trains and using renewable energy to power these trains could begin a movement towards less reliance with cars. Freeganism also seems like a flexible way for people to show some consideration for the climate without the daunting task of committing to veganism or worrying about what they can or can't eat. It's simply keeping food from being wasted. 
   <br><br>
I also support his stance towards collective action. Much of what he proposes seems daunting because it seems like big changes need to be implemented in today's society. This is going to require convincing politicians of the urgency of the issue free of fossil fuel influence and interests. It means moving towards a more human-centered rather than profit-driven society. I was also very interested in the idea of half-Earth. It's incredibly important to remember that we are not the only living things on this planet. We are co-inhabitants and we need to acknowledge that for the sake of other species' survival, especially considering the exponential increase of various species' extinctions.

I agree with your comment. I Like that Kalmus draws attention to freeganism and transportation because as mentioned in Ken's lecture, these are things we can do ourselves. We do not have to wait till a law is passed to be able to do these things and we do not need to spend more to do these. Public transportation is actually a cheaper option than buying a car as we have learned from previous lectures. I feel that using less cars could also spark a movement as well. I think this actually needs to happen anyway since I feel that roads cater more to cars than mass modes of transportation. Once public modes of transportation become more popular than they will become easier to use and more reliable. I also like that he introduces the idea of freeganism as well. I know that many of the comments read in class, show how it would be hard for that person to cut out meat out of their life since they love it so much. Freeganism is a good idea as well because they can still eat the meat, but just need not be wasteful of any of it. When it comes to convincing politicians, I can't help but feel a bit pessimistic. This mainly comes from the week we watched Merchants and Climate of Doubt. It just seems that many politicians don't necessarily care for the issue or are beings funded by oil companies. I know there are some that care for the issue, but nevertheless not a lot of change has occurred in terms of preventing climate change. I mean, the Paris agreement was signed and it did not change a lot because we kept putting more and more CO2 into the atmosphere. This is why I like Kalmus's suggestions so much because we do not need to wait for political action to begin doing them.

I enjoyed the chapter readings of "Being the Change" for a few reasons. Firstly it addressed several aspects of how we as climate activists can reduce our carbon footprint and encourage others to do so. Kalmus addressed the major issues of transportation, consumerism, the fossil fuel industry, and other key components of the climate crisis. I also like how he addressed that the smallest habits and actions we perform on a daily basis add up to having the greatest impact on our environment. Some of the examples he used were laundry (washing and drying) and showering. Kalmus makes it a point, that we should be aware of our actions and the effects they have on our environment. Secondly I appreciated how Kalmus talked about the politics involved in the climate crisis. He starts out by stating, "in the US, the richest 20% are responsible for 32% of emissions, whereas the poorest 20% are responsible for only 9% of emissions". I thought this was important to address because it shows how social inequality plays a key role in the climate crisis. The first people to be blamed and questioned about climate change are lower-income people of color. In the Collective Action chapter he brings up solutions on how to get the fossil fuel industry out of politics, "We need strict new campaign finance laws: corporations must not be allowed to con- tribute to political campaigns, and neither should any sort of organization". If politicians continue to endorse huge corporations that contribute the most to climate change, nothing will change. I agree with Kalmus in that stricter finance laws would be extremely beneficial to our climate.




</p><hr>


<p>
One part of the reading gave me a crazy realization. Kalmus addressed the three reasons he chose to reduce his emissions. When I think about why I would try to reduce my emissions, the first thing that pops into my head is to mitigate climate change. His reasons made me so inspired and made me rethink this whole course. 
  <br><br>
His first reason was because he is able to enjoy living with less fossil fuels. If we all reflect on our lives we think that our economic growth and wealth is what makes our lives better, but in reality this is just what society has trained us to think so that we become hyper consumers for our entire lives. Scientifically speaking what makes us happy is dopamine and dopamine is released when we’re exercising and doing activities we enjoy. This fits perfectly with a low fossil fuel lifestyle, by all the biking and walking we can do instead of driving. We also find happiness in having relationships with friends and family and a living community. This fits perfectly with a plenitude economy, which allows for less work and more valuable time spent with the people we love. In conjunction with being happy individuals we can be more healthy and avoid heart disease and hypertension with less beef and processed food in our diets, both can be solved by switching to more plant-based, local, organic diets and by planting community or family gardens. These are some of the reasons Peter has learned to enjoy living with less fossil fuels and some of the reasons I can see myself adapting to become more fulfilled with my life in a less materialistic way.
  <br><br>
The second way, was something really inspiring to me, especially after all that I have learned in this course. He talks about reducing emissions and reliance on fossil fuels because he’s aware of the harm that it causes the planet, the animals, and especially the other humans. We as Americans and part of the developed world, share the planet with all the other animals here and with the humans of the undeveloped and developing world. How can we continue to support the fossil fuels industry just out of convenience for ourselves, when we are creating an uninhabitable earth for everyone else who isn’t reaping the same benefits. Not only are we putting developing nations in danger of extreme weather and sea level rising, we are exploiting them for fast fashion, while at the same time they are already struggling to make enough money to feed themselves and their families or find access to clean water. These are basic human needs that must be met, and there is no excuse for us to be living in mansions, flying all over the world, and excessively shopping.
  <br><br>
Peter Kalmus’ last reason is so important and also ties into the 20 things video that Ken made this week. What I got out of it was basically that we have to be the change we want to see in the world, like Ghandi said. He makes these changes in his life and is also able to share his results and knowledge with friends and people in his community. If we all attempt to integrate these changes into our current lives we can majorly shift the culture. It’s possible and it’s required to sustain life on earth.

<p>
This week’s reading I honestly really enjoyed. Although we watched the documentary last week, it was refreshing to envision in more specific detail how Peter and his family actually enjoy and benefit from living this certain lifestyle. From my life’s perspective given the way I was raised, not driving to work is an unheard of idea and flying is a travel necessity. Going even further, eating healthy and saving money is thought of in a positive light in my family, but limiting yourself in terms of food and purchasing material things is almost looked down upon. My parents worked really hard to get where they are in life, and they don’t see why they shouldn’t enjoy what they can as much as they can. However, I know that my family rarely considers the environment or the planet over their own comfort, so this may explain why. Given the climate change delay we experience, they and many others don’t think about the upcoming drastic consequences of climate change, and therefore, do not see a need to change their ways. So, reading further about Peter and his family enjoying this way of life, I was pleasantly surprised to find that riding his bike to work makes him happy, that eating a climatarian diet made him healthier, or that purchasing less saved him money. There are real benefits to living this way, but unfortunately a major part of the population won't even consider them.

I agree that this week’s reading was much more digestible in terms of Peter Kalmus’ credibility of adapting to a new lifestyle with his family. Kalmus details his personal lifestyle changes as a vegetarian, freegan, biker, and environmentalist. I can also relate so much to what you have to say about your personal experiences! In the materialistic society that we live in, there are so much “basic necessities” that people stigmatize as normal to have despite these objects actually being a privilege. People do tend to live in the moment as you state because the future is unpredictable, so it does become easier to act upon without thinking of the impacts one has. Before taking this course, I thought less about my personal carbon footprint with transportation and consumption being so normalized for me too while growing up. Normal does not make it okay. The fact is that being environmentally conscious really opens your eyes to the facts behind the way people choose to live their lives even if it has harmful consequences.


<br><hr>
I agree with you. As the graph shows, flying used to be the major carbon footprint contributor for Peter Kalmus, which was about 70 percent of his total carbon emission back in 2012. However, since he decided to reduce his carbon footprint, we can see that he took 0 flights in 2014 and also reduced his driving emission to a lower percentage by simply replacing cars with bikes. Moreover, the U.S. mean carbon emission is about four times that of the human, which is quite unbelievable and should be really considered and changed. According to chapter 14,  "Most economists therefore agree that the best way to address climate change is through a direct price on greenhouse gas emissions: a tax or fee". I also consider it as a great way to reduce the emission. As Ken discussed in the lecture about Copenhagen, the price of motor vehicles is really high since the government put a carbon tax on it. I believe the United States also can do that since it is done by many countries all around the world already.

I really enjoyed watching being the change and because it shows that even the smallest actions can make a difference, despite us thinking that we are too small to make an actual difference. One person can inspire others, and that can keep the change and momentum going. Kalmus does a great job of showing that life without fossil fuels is not only possible, but can be preferable. This film inspired me to be better and to learn to be less wasteful, more conscious of how I live my everyday life, and that no positive change in terms of the climate is too small.  I often find myself scoffing at me thinking that using a resuseable water bottle and reusable bags and shopping at thrift stores will make a difference, but after watching the film and hearing what Kalmus had to say, it reinforced the fact that nothing is too small.

After reading "being the change" I thought it was extraordinary.
  <br><br>
 Having watched the film, it was pleasant to see Peter Kalmus approach the Climate Crisis all the more comprehensively and discussion about what others can do as far as possible their emanations. The film was extremely centered around his own life and I thought that was incredible, it was more enthusiastically to perceive what I could do as an undergrad. This is significant on the grounds that it permits common residents, (for example, myself) to truly get a handle on the measure of harm that we are doing to our planet. I imagined that this section was an extraordinary perused on the grounds that it depicts, in incredible detail, Peter's own memory of how he has functioned as a person to bring down his effect on the environment.eating solid and setting aside cash is thought of in a constructive light in my family, yet restricting yourself as far as nourishment and buying material things is nearly looked downward on. 
  <br><br>

The main way you can make individuals being engaged with the change is to be simply the change first and constantly. I truly respected his activities and I do concur we need more individuals, regardless of whether viewed themselves as activists or not, to be the change, from each and every part of day by day lives. 
  <br><br>

This book causes individuals to see that practicing environmental safety doesn't constantly mean turning out to be vegan. For Peter's situation, the greatest effect he could make on decreasing his carbon impression was surrendering plane flights. After understanding this, I am propelled to attempt to roll out little improvements. Everyone endeavors to make more satisfaction in their lives, so on the off chance that we can do that and furthermore ensure our condition, it is a success win circumstance.

I liked how the the film was centered on his life as well; it was almost like a way to take us along with him in his everyday life. It was very intimate and personal, and that helped to exemplify his goal of showing that living with such a lifestyle can be enjoyable. However, I thought the book succeeded in many of the places that the film fell short, whether that was through concrete numbers and science, or building ethos, or simply just being more direct with his goals. I liked the extra insight that the book gave, as well as how clear it was in showing how we personally can implement similar methods into our lives.
  <br><br>
I'm not sure how much I agree with you in your final takeaway from the film; I agree that there are evidently other ways to mitigate the climate crises besides going vegan, but I feel that that is kind of beside Peter's point. He was able to accomplish attaining a lifestyle in which he strove to be as close to carbon zero as possible (1/10th of the average emissions). In doing this, he promotes discussion and propagates a cultural shift in which many of his viewers can try to attain a similar lifestyle. While applying these little improvements is definitely great, it's only with assessing all the different parts of our lives and finding sustainable solutions to ALL of these aspects of life that we will be able to fully mitigate the crisis, which is something Peter is able to show us with this reading.

I liked this weeks reading, especially chapter 9, “Leaving Fossil Fuel”. Peter Kalmus laid out his previous carbon footprint, indicating what emitted the most fossil fuels into the air, and described how he lowered it. I appreciated how Peter was very honest about why he did this. He did not try to make it seem like he thought that his actions were saving the planet, he said that this process of lowering his footprint reduced his feelings of guilt and depression. One small thing I found off-putting was when he described that he say this process as a “fun game”. Not that there’s anything wrong with this on its own and I’m glad he had fun reducing his carbon footprint, however, it reminded me how many do not have the luxury to experience this as a fun game. He mentioned that the average person in Bangladesh has half his carbon footprint, and this is not because they see avoiding CO2 emissions as a fun game, it is because many of them do not have the luxury to do things like fly frequently or own a car. I think it is important to consider this.

I agree with you. After reading the two chapters, “Leaving Fossil Fuel” and “Being the Change”, I learned a lot about how to estimate my own emissions. The reading focuses more on the personal life, how Kalmus was able to analyze his own carbon footprint, and the specific things he did to reduce his CO2 emissions. It is really impressive to see how much work he did in order to minimize the emissions. One thing I remembered was that after he decided not to fly anymore, his CO2 emission immediately greatly reduced. He tried to reduce emissions from other aspects too such as having a plant diet, driving less, and so on, but the sum of all of these reductions is far less than the contribution of taking no planes. Also, although he made dramatic lifestyle changes, his individual carbon footprint was still greater than the average person in Bangladesh. This made me think that we are the ones causing climate change but the consequences are actually affecting those who have no part in our actions. Therefore, we must be the ones who initiate change and start influencing the world with the concept that “Less is more”.

I really enjoyed this week's reading by Peter Kalmus. The collective action section of the article informed me about the carbon fee vs the carbon tax. Before reading this, I was under the impression that a carbon tax would be most efficient in lowering fossil fuel use and benefiting the environment. Now I know that a carbon tax would go straight to the government and it would be harder to pass while a carbon fee would come most likely as an annual check taken directly from money deduction from carbon emissions. The cap- and -trade would be the worst scenario. This would ironically encourage fossil fuel use and benefit big business. I also enjoyed the "Being the Change" chapter. I agreed with Kalmus's logic  if we know that fossil fuels, meat consumption, and waste are bad for the environment, then are actions should align with this. The sad truth is most people know the consequences of their fuel and waste habits yet do it anyways and claim to love the environment/planet etc.

I greatly enjoyed reading the two chapters from "Being the Change" by Peter Kalmus because they were able to give his perspective and provide a more substantive argument than the documentary had been able to. In chapter 9, Kalmus succinctly details his own carbon emissions, provides a way to tally your own emissions, and addresses the often used counterarguments when it comes to reducing one's emissions. I appreciate that he addressed what many people feel when they are faced with reducing their carbon emissions, often times feeling conflicted or addicted to their lifestyle. They feel a need or an obligation towards keeping that lifestyle. His remarks touched a point that many others do not, that in reducing your own emissions it is going to be hard and difficult to endure. The anecdote regarding the woman and her work in traveling to Africa for childbirth assistance particularly resonated with me as he replied in a manner that many do not. His reply focused on that airplanes should not be required to help serve your goals in life. That if you want to help a far away community, do so permanently or help locally in other ways. In chapter 14, he shifts focus from individual action to collective action. As often with political or global information, this chapter did not appeal to me as much. It spoke a lot about what the world needs collectively, but it's hard to imagine many of the things listed actually happening. For example, in one of his sections he starts it off with "Maybe, as you read this, the US has already enacted a national car- bon fee. (One can hope.)" The most glaring part of the quote is parenthesized as it sums up the general feeling I've had for a lot of the collective requirements, just hope. I wish I was more optimistic about it, but when people blatantly disregarded many of these warnings in the past, it's hard to keep that hope alive.

<p>
In the chapter “Collective Action,” Kalmus does a great job of calling out the true propellants of climate change: countries and companies that are exploiting the planet on a large scale basis. Although normal citizens can decrease their carbon emissions in ways that can cause a change, it is still not fast enough at the rate the climate crisis is affecting our planet. This is not to say that lifestyle changes on a personal level are not important, but we must do more than this in order to save the planet. The fact is that as the consumers we are largely demanding products that rely on fossil fuels, and companies will not want to stop anytime soon if they are still receiving the benefits that we are providing. We as a collective must voice our opinions on changing the way we use fossil fuels and change regulations on policies such as Cap and Trade that are often exploited even if it is good in theory. This chapter really gave insight into the complexity of the issue, as it expands into different territories such as redistributing wealth and having a stable population.

Yeah, I think that we need to have both a top down change and a change from the bottom up if we want to combat climate change effectively. What I mean by this is that, as you said, we need to stop relying so much on products that heavily use fossil fuels to work. Things like cars and energy from burning coal need to be phased out in favor of public transport, bikes, and renewable/nuclear energy. People actually favoring bikes and public transport is a form of bottom up change. The government building better public transport and bike lanes would be top down. Even renewables like solar can be bottom up as I see many houses individually installing solar panels on their house to lower their electricity bill.We need both to be able to effect change, a bottom up movement will often effect a top down movement as the government sees what is possible and the resultant change will reach many more people. Even climate change denialists will have to reduce their carbon foot print if a carbon tax is passed.

"Saving the earth" is a fantasy of the collective self of society. It allows us to continue to mistakenly believe that we are separate from the biosphere, and that what happens on "earth", while sad for polar bears, does not affect us. If you're feeling down, maybe you're trying to save the world. It's frustrating to have an impossible goal. I think a lot of people subconsciously want to save the world. But saving or not is a false binary, born of the instant gratification mentality that got us into this mess in the first place. Saving the world is our fantasy. The opposite of wanting to save the world is sincere patience. With patience, you will be humble, open, and have a more technical ability to make positive changes. Each of us has the power to make the world a better place, or a worse place. Each of us can choose to push the world toward a warmer temperature, or pull it back. I wanted to save the world. I finally accepted that I couldn't, and it brought me peace. Instead, I try to live a good life so I can change the world.

What stuck out to me the most from the readings was this line at the very beginning of Chapter 9, Leaving Fossil Fuel,  that says, "However, I still emit nearly twice the average Bangladeshi,1 and infinitely more than a wild, nonhuman Earthling." The last part of it really stuck out to me. We all emit infinitely more than a wild, nonhuman Earthling. This really got me thinking. Humans are the only species that are making this climate crisis. It is so unfair that we do this when the world has millions of other species who are potentially going to die because of us and they didn't cause any of it. So what if they aren't as advanced as humans, they do not deserve to have their lives and their species lives cut short because humans decided we should pollute our planet.

Also through this reading, I am very interested in doing my own carbon footprint calculations. It is kind of hard to do as I am in a dorm living situation and on a dining hall meal plan which means those aspects are hard to calculate, but I am very curious as to how high my carbon footprint is (it's definitely over 2 tons), and see what part of my life is making it the largest and see if I can cut down in that area. 
  <br><br>


I was also very interested to see climate change being called a market failure because it totally is. I am in Econ 1 right now and we have been discussing how the market fails to find an optimal equilibrium when you don't incorporate all the costs and benefits into the market. Pollution is often times not incorporated and is known as an externality. This leads to it being overproduced because the huge cost of it is not taken into account. If pollution was correctly accounted for in our economy, we would not see the extent of climate change that we are seeing.

The “Leaving Fossil Fuels” chapter was very informative. The chapter included many very important CO2 emission statistics on various areas such as food, electricity, and waste. I really like the diagrams and charts that were included because they made it very easy to visualize the effects of the changes that Peter made. One of the important takeaways that I took was that while it may not seem like the case, personal reduction really does help. This is because by taking individual action, we can slowly shift the culture. We will influence the people around us, who in turn can influence the people around them. With this chain reaction, eventually the culture can start to shift. I also thought it was pretty cool that Peter included a recipe to help us estimate our own emissions. The list that he included of the climate impact of everyday actions was also very helpful to see some things that you normally would not pay attention to and think of emitting CO2. For example, he measured how much power he uses on his computer and calculated the amount of CO2 emissions it would release per year through the use of electricity. Using a laptop about 8 hours per day comes out to about 140 kg of CO2 emissions per year which is quite a lot more than I would have thought.

Claire Chen I agree. I like how peter made it easier for us to visualize and keep track of our emissions using organization. It would be nice if these practical ways of measuring our emissions was a more widespread practice. Many of us would be able to apply this knowledge to creative endeavors like Peter’s car powered by veggie oil. It was very informative and even allowed me to look back and realize that leaving fossil fuels has had a profound effect on those practicing it as seen through our new culture that yearns for electric vehicles and alternative milks.

This week’s reading by Peter Kalmus was very eye-opening in that he was able to reflect on his own carbon footprint and compare it to the average American. It was inspiring to see the changes he made to his life in order to reduce his family’s carbon emission. Not only was he able to give statistics and charts that showed his change but he is also able to layout solutions that could be made to the climate crisis. I very much liked that rather than just hitting readers with statistics and facts, he was able to highlight his own journey and showcase the changes he has been able to make to benefit the environment. It makes you think a lot about how you affect the environment by going about your daily activities. What I found interesting was when Peter mentioned he preferred slow travel to avoid using airplanes. It made me reflect on my own life where I prefer to get there faster and use an airplane rather than taking the bus or train. Although it could be a bit of an inconvenience to travel without a flight, I would much rather change my method of travel to lessen the amount of CO2 released. I also liked it when he mentioned his car Maeby that ran on waste vegetable oil. Switching to this method allowed Peter to eliminate 400 kg CO2 per year. It's so cool to see how Peter was able to lessen his carbon footprint just by switching to WVO. Although switching a lifestyle one is so used to may sound intimidating, knowing the positive effects it could have on the environment makes it worth it.

</p><hr>


<p>

Okay, hear me out first and then correct my misconceptions..." Burning plant oil doesn’t increase the net CO2 in the atmosphere. The plants capture CO2 from the atmosphere to make the oil, and burning the oil releases that same CO2 back to the atmosphere for no net gain." After reading this sentence I thought, doesn't that mean burning trees is a no net gain? Trees take in CO2 to grow and when we burn them we just release that CO2 back into the atmosphere like the vegetable oil.  Burning trees is obviously not good so this makes me think that Peter burning vegetable oil is also not good but he is just trying to frame it in a positive light. I'm a little confused here. 
     <br><br>
 Again, I am playing devil's advocate here but I feel like the language used in Peters book is loaded and I rather someone give it to me straight. "I now prefer slow and adventurous travel to fast travel. " although he may be honest in his desire to be more community based I feel like Peter uses adventurous in place of "inconvenient". The inconvenience of added time in traveling is what many Americans shy away from. I rather Peter say he prefers slower and less carbon taxing travel than adventurous because I don't find adding hour to my travel adventurous. I know the journey can be just as great as the destination but if your desire is to get to the destination efficiently and time intensively, you will not want to take the slow route. I hope that carbon-free transportation could become as convenient as our current ways of traveling.

In the chapters of "Being the change", it is pretty amazing that he has ways to successfully calculate a rough idea and put all of us in terms of kg of GHG emissions. These stats and facts are good for those that still need stats to be convinced of the injustices of this world. The people that need to be reminded of the wild crazy things that are happening on every corner of this earth. To be honest, I wish that we can all see the injustice everywhere and address problems at their root! If we can recognize that the American government spends millions to billions of dollars on military then we can recognize that at the opposite end of every gun point is a human being or a living creature. IF we can acknowledge that we are killing HUMANS, then we can stop the production of weapons and machines which can save so much money, pollution, and green house gasses. Hahaha why don’t we just have a world full of people that care.

I really admire the way that Peter goes on about truly making a change and how he really emphasizes happiness and truly attempts to understand people around him to truly be able to captivate different ways we can all change. He doesn't just sit there and spit facts at us, he sits there and appeals us with his intuition, his drive, his own actions, and much more beyond that to help influence our very own decision. To him, the top 5 true-difference making things we could possibly do is: stop fucking traveling through airplanes, vegetarianism, bicyclism, freeganism, and composting. It's truly mind-bogging to think that an American's diet can produce about 3 tons of CO2, which is already blowing about 1 ton over the recommended amount of CO2 we should be producing to help ease carbon footprint. I think the book and the documentary on his lifestyle perfectly compliment each other because he not only tell su what we can do, but exemplifies it and utilizes it in his own personal life. He also really helps us by showing how to check and track our own carbon emission footprint, which I think is something we should be doing because our mindless actions don't ever keep track of things like that. Peter also emphasizes this ideology of "collective action" and he's completely right in emphasizing it as much as he can because I believe we can all collectively make the change, but we are a afraid of really starting ourselves, because we would stand out and Americans don't like being uncomfortable so they stand behind every one else and continue on not doing anything about it. We truly need to come together and exercise these sort of actions, because not only does the future of our children and grand children depend on It, but the future of this Earth.

This is the first time I've heard the term bicylism and I feel this word is worthy of the dictionary. This work can define the pros and cons involved with this eco-friendly transportation method providing exercise, but can be unsafe and tragic with poorly maintained bike baths.  
  <br><br>

After reading the perspective of a climate scientists, I wish there could be more renowned climate scientists. I feel a very beneficial job of the future could be a climate technician. This government employed, well-paid, blue collar worker would go from home to home measuring appliances and technology to prevent leakage from unnecessarily damaging features at ones property. Like the author mentioned in the reading, he found a couple light-bulbs brutally expanding his carbon footprint. I wonder how many things don’t function correctly that we don’t even know but could easily stop. 
  <br><br>

I enjoyed the collective action holistic perspective the author approached in these couple chapters, because he is a human before a scientist. By focusing on what an ordinary individual can do right now is key.

I was impressed to read how Kalmus estimated his emissions and reduced his carbon footprint by a factor of 10. He did this by giving up flying, the following freeganism and growing his food among other things. When discussing why we should cut our emissions, he said, “Less fossil fuel has meant more connection with the land, with food, with family and friends, and with community”. It reminded me of this week's film, Happy, where the big French family always made time to get together and live off the land. In Peter Kalmus's case, he was able to dedicate more time to his family after he stopped flying to conferences. Then things like biking to school with their kids, gardening as a family, and slow traveling reveal how he can accomplish those connections. 
  <br><br>

Kalmus also showed the reader how they could calculate their emissions and while reading that, I understood that my biggest problem was buying new stuff. I do not fly, I ride my bike every day and started eating less meat, so one of my biggest problems was buying new stuff along with the waste that is produced. The statistics he presented of the average American spending over $6,000 yearly on new stuff left me shocked. I looked back at the stuff I bought last year and it was mostly things for my new apartment which I thought were necessary. My amazon account exposed me because opening the tab of ‘purchases for 2019’ left me feeling so guilty as I saw how much I ordered monthly. This will be one of my challenges to try and reduce my carbon footprint since 300 kg CO2e comes from textiles. It was sad that I was not very shocked to hear that the trash of one American generates more CO2 than the average person in Bangladesh. As this was something pointed out to me by my roommate who is from Korea, she was very shocked to see how much trash our whole complex generates. It made sense once she explained that in Korea you pay by the bag depending on the household waste. I think this would be helpful to implement to promote the reduction of waste to Americans.

I mentioned in a previous comment that I was a little saddened by the fact that things that are relatively easier to switch, such as dietary choices, had less of an effect on carbon footprints as opposed to something more difficult, such as driving. I'm glad that I got to see the details surrounding food consumption: I did not realize that something as simple as composting could help. I'm glad that Kalmus' point is something that Ken has also gone over, that knowledge is meaningless without action to back it up. While it is true that sacrifices must be made in order for our individual efforts to significantly cut down on our footprints, Peter demonstrates that it is possible. His solutions seem practical and relatively easy to implement, except perhaps regarding transportation (but that's a personal doubt). Because in class, we had gone over a lot of facts and emphasized how government officials and big companies control our approach to environmental issues to an extent, it is nice to see firsthand how one person can make such a powerful impact on emissions. I, like many others, have a tendency to believe that individual action is not enough to affect the climate crisis significantly, but Kalmus' evidence is hard to ignore.

<p>
After reading "Leaving Fossil Fuels" and "Collective Action", I felt very aware of how to change the impact of individuals on climate change. Sadly, many people don't think that personal change will produce any change, which is why many people don't think they need to change their behavior or lifestyle. I was shocked when I read that food is another important factor in carbon emissions. I never thought that to get to a grocery store or restaurant, I would consume a lot of resources and travel. Earth people need to switch from fossil fuels to clean energy, such as wind or solar energy. There are many benefits to moving to these forms of energy, such as new jobs, markets, investments, and a cleaner planet. Not only will it have a beneficial economic impact, but it may also help alleviate the entire climate crisis.
  <br><br>
I think in an era when we are desperate about the climate crisis, because we are not in a government or agency that has the power to change policy, it is really important to remember what we can do on a personal level. Even though these individual changes are small and trivial, they can actually motivate others to make changes and trigger a chain reaction. Frequent gatherings of people are where the climate crisis movement needs to advance so that people in places of power can change policies on a large scale.

Zoe, I love how you mentioned the possible outcome of a chain reaction! I never really thought of it that way myself! I will admit, I was initially hesitant on how productive or crucial my small daily habits would impact the earth. I would always push it out of my mind by thinking "I'm 1 in 7 billion people... this small action of mine is harmless." But so many others are saying that to themselves too! 
  <br><br>
Don't worry, I have definitely evolved to changing the way I think regarding climate crisis and what I can do help prevent any further damage to our earth. Anyways, I completely agree with you on coming together with what we've changed or improved to help the earth. It can very well motivate and encourage others to promote change within their own lives and the lives of those around them. Only then will people of power start listening to us about our concerns for our precious earth! We can achieve so much if we all come together and reach our greatest potential!

In the chapter "Leaving Fossil Fuel" the author stated that he was able to reduce his carbon emissions by significantly by first understanding the sources of his climate impact. By identifying that his biggest emission of greenhouse gas was air travel, he was able to pinpoint the exact problem and work to reduce it. I feel as if it is necessary for every individual to identify what exactly their biggest emission of greenhouse gas is and work to reduce it, if not prevent it entirely. This mention of air travel brought me back to one of the earlier lectures that we had where we talked about just how big of an impact flying has on the environment. I recall the example Ken gave of a solution of taking one large trip every 5 years instead of taking a small trip every year. This makes sense because you can limit your time and distance flying. People don't really see value in personally reducing their own footprint. That is because they believe that just one individual is not enough to make a drastic change. However, if each individual worked to reduce their imprint, we will all be able to make a significant impact. 
  <br><br>
Peter Kalmus stated that he reduces for three reasons: he enjoys living with less fossil fuel, he's aligning his actions with his principles, and his personal reduction helps to shift the culture. All of these reasons resonate with me as well. I believe that we as a population have become all to reliant on fossil fuels and that has served to negatively affect all of us. By choosing to begin making these changes in our individual lives, that can shift the culture and help influence others to make the same decisions as well.

When Reading "Be the Change," I realized the potential I have in myself to make changes to positively impact the environment. When I learned that the the average person in the United States creates more carbon dioxide compared to someone in Bangladesh, I was really surprised. This really goes to show how wasteful Americans are and how invested we are in materialism. Leading a simplistic lifestyle is key to lowering carbon dioxide emissions and help solve the climate crisis.
  <br><br>
I believe that veganism is an important lifestyle change that can easily be incorporated in anyone's lifestyle. Taking small steps is important in order to successfully transition to a plant based diet. I more people were to transition to a plant based diet, emissions would decrease drastically.

I relate to Sophia’s comment. After reading “Be The Change”, I found a new perspective on what I can personally do as a college student. It’s quite relieving reading what I can do in my everyday life instead of believing that I can only do a big change for the climate crisis if I start from the top and make my way down. Even the small steps I take now can help reduce and alleviate factors of the climate crisis. 
  <br><br>
All it takes is small everyday or weekly things. For example, maybe investing in a drying rack or tying a string up in my living room to dry my clothes instead of using a dryer. On that note, I will also reduce and try not to use my hair dryer at all in order to use less energy in the house. It’s the little things that can also make a big difference.






</span></div><hr>

<p>

After reading the two assigned chapters of "Being the Change" by Peter Kalmus, I am inspired to make lifestyle changes similar to what Kalmus outlines in this reading. For example, I had previously not considered hanging my clothes to dry instead of using a dryer in order to save emissions this way. I have a drying rack which I do use frequently, but it didn't even cross my mind to put the maximum amount of clothes on it so that I can easily save emissions in a way that does not even change how I live my life. This reading also has made me consider becoming a vegetarian even more so then I was previously thinking, as his lifestyle change was so drastic, it is the least I can do in terms of saving the environment. I felt that the graphs in this reading were very helpful in understanding Kalmus' thoughts and beliefs on the issue, because they clearly outlined his total emissions and made it very clear why he wanted to make a change for the better. Once again, I completely support the notion of biking, and feel that this is a completely doable and efficient way to help the environment (and save some gas money! )

</p><hr>


<p>

This reading makes me slightly more hopeful that we may be able to reverse the damage we have caused to our planet. In chapter nine, Kalmus validates his decision to reduce via three primary reasons: connection, security, and change. The first reason Kalmus mentions, connection, is one I too realized after trying to reduce my emissions. After making a commitment to reduce my emissions as much as I possibly could, I felt a strange connection between myself and the world around me. It was then that I realized it: taking faster modes of transportation like a car or bus even limits my time in the open air, and further limits my experience to be had outside. If I just walk or bike, I have more time to enjoy the subtleties of nature’s beauty. Secondly, Kalmus mentions the cognitive dissonance one experiences when they knowingly damage our planet with emissions despite knowing the effects of such pollution. One may feel guilty while doing this, and rightfully so. I still feel pangs of guilt when driving more than I need to, despite all the ways I try to reduce my footprint in other ways. Finally, Kalmus mentions the notion of change. Many chock individual reduction efforts to useless endeavors with no hope, since the industrial parts of the world make up such a large part of the pollution our planet experiences. However, if each person tries to reduce emissions and tries to get others to as well, we can truly create change from the bottom up, and this is why I still have hope.

After reading “Being the change” I felt it was a lot like the other videos and readings we have seen and read. “Being the change” is a story about a man who changes the way he lives life by quitting planes, Vegetarianism, Bicycling instead of driving, Composting, and Freeganism. He explains the benefits of making these changes and explains why everyone should do the same. The last video we watched was, being the change but in video format, which was essentially the same thing as the reading to me. In the video I felt like I got more information out of it and most importantly it was more impactful for me. This could be because the video is more interesting and keeps the viewer interested the whole time. The one thing I liked about the reading was the charts. I thought they were very impactful because they showed Pete’s carbon emissions before he changed his lifestyle and what he used the most carbon on. They also show the Carbon emissions after he changed his lifestyle, and you can see the impact it has on the planet. One other thing I liked about the reading was the amount of statistics it gives based on Cars, Airplanes, Methane etc. These statistics really put it into perspective on how much of an impact flying and driving has on the planet. Pete does a good job of explaining how we can better ourselves and reduce the emissions of flying and driving. Pete’s advice was very impactful for me and made me realize that we all need to do better.

I too found the video for Being the Change to be more informative for me, barring the graphs.  I think part of it was the way the movie flows and presents people, but also the book reads a bit more like a scientific paper.  The graphs were of particular interest as they showed the carbon output for a fairly average person.  To be fair, Kalmus flew more often than the average American, but beyond that was fairly similar.  I also appreciated how he showed the percentage of emissions from each category.  

  <br><br>

I think the most important part of examining Kalmus is by looking at the results of all of his actions, even the small ones.  For example, seeing the reduction of his emissions when he stopped flying was informative and helps bring Ken's point home that flying is one of the worst things you can do environmentally.

Throughout this course I have carried the thought with me; what can I change personally to help mitigate the climate crisis? It took me 9 weeks to be self-reflective during one of the readings, but here we are. I am happy with my efforts where I can confidently say I am making better choices than a lot of people. I walk to school everyday and have come to enjoy it, even though I have a car here I rarely use it because errand runs in my house usually are a carpool session of the other girls who need things or just want to come along, and I eat a primarily vegan diet if not perfectly than vegetarian. I slowly shifted my eating habits because I am a student so I am BROKE and slowly realized that I could buy way more fruits, vegetables, and grains rather than meat or frozen meals. Since I already do all of these things already I have found that I feel more comfortable making steps forward that would be even more beneficial for the planet, since I have covered some of the baby steps already.

One of the issues brought up in the 14th chapter is the Carbon tax. From a human perspective I think that it is a good idea. Even though the cost of airplane tickets and natural gas will become increasingly expensive, this will allow us as a nation to accelerate towards renewables. However, a part of me also wonders how long this would take? By enforcing a carbon tax and having an assumedly slow transition over to better forms of public transportations this can be extremely detrimental to people who cannot afford to be paying the new price, while having no second option of other methods of transportation. Sometimes I feel selfish because I am frustrated that our lives are the ones that have to change dramatically in order to fix the mess from the older generations that came before us. The changes that we can make individually that we see through this reading are encouraging, however the general reasons for this damage control were initially out of our hands and are now thrown in our lap. On another note, I really enjoyed reading through Kalmus’s creation of the list where you can estimate your own emissions. Reading through the list point after point alone reminds you how many ways the things you are using add to this issue, it puts your own actions into perspective.

One of the changes Peter Kalmus mentioned that peaked my attention the most was his altered car, Maebe, which was powered mainly on waste vegetable oil. This invention allows him to still drive and does not add to carbon emissions aside from the brief starting of the car that still runs on oil. This idea was mind-blowing to me but I understand most people cannot make this change. An average person's equivalent would just be to buy an electric vehicle and drop thousands of dollars. However, even with this incredible invention, I found it intriguing that Peter still decided to bike everywhere, thus showing his true commitment to personal action and the climate.  
  <br><br>
Another point I would like to discuss is to be a scientist advocate. As all the climate deniers are quick to undermine and discredit scientists and their work, while they have no actual, face to face knowledge of the subject. Bringing up a point from last week, no one would question a medical scientist like they do to climate scientists, even though they both have heavily peer-reviewed published articles. The doubt here is created by the fossil fuel industries and politicians that they fund. Therefore, revealing that even if personal lifestyle changes do not make a significant impact on global carbon emissions, it will significantly impact the attitude of the community, which will, in turn, grow to affect the policies. Thus, personal changes can, in fact, make a change in the current carbon trends.

I agree, the change of his altered car was one of the more interesting ones. While people can be more easily persuaded to stop using things like washers or dryers, as Kalmus does, altering one’s car to have it run mainly on waste vegetable oil is something not a lot of people can do. While it’s one way to help the environment, it’s not a way that a lot of people can convert to. As you point out, purchasing an electric vehicle would be an easier way to help, but a lot of people can’t afford to sell their cars and purchase electric ones; beyond that, as pointed out by the professor earlier in the quarter, it harms the environment even to make an electric car, let alone drive it.

While watching the film last week and reading a selection of “Being the Change” I also agree that Peter’s hybrid diesel and vegetable oil Mercedes-Benz was the most fascinating thing. I almost couldn’t believe it. However, it is a thing and Peter is helping the planet by doing so. His successfulness with vegetable oil as a means of gas proves to everyone that it is possible to still do what you want (in this case driving) and be environmentally conscious about it. Peter Kalmus and his family are an amazing example of how an individual’s action does make a difference. Prior to this class I was the person who was set in stone action at the individual level could not be that impactful as those choices made at a larger institutional level. However, after being in this course for the past nine or so weeks, I was foolish to ever think so. These individual choices that we make (i.e. Peter using veggie oil as fuel, biking, eating vegan), collectively, make a huge impact and is worth being noted and done. By switching to this way of thought I have personally thought about eating more plant-based meals and reconsidering my modes of transportation.



<br><hr>
I agree that I found the vegetable oil interesting. It is kinda funny but I started to think about back to the future. At the end of the first movie and the beginning of the second movie, Doc drives in with the Dalorean. When he parks he explains that the car does not run on fuel anymore. Instead the car runs on waste and he throws in like bananas and soda cans and garbage. It is an interesting idea. The vegetable oil reminded me of that idea. I also agree that it is interesting and really cool that Peter still rides his bike. Bikes can be very overlooked as alternate methods of transport. Bikes are super handy and easy to use. Also you're getting some exercise which is always much needed. It is true that climate scientists are constantly questioned. Everything that a climate scientist releases is rigorously reviewed and criticized. this is due to the false images the fossil fuel companies and other big corporations are trying to block from the truth. The best thing that I can do as well as others, is to continue to do our own changes and try to change parts of our lives that are detrimental to our climate.

Before even reading the chapters, I loved the layout. It states clearly what to focus on and how it impacts our climate. After reading chapter 9 I feel kind of bummed. No matter how low I try to keep my carbon footprint there is always something that makes it go up slightly. Using my computer to write this comment, charging my phone, taking the bus downtown, or even just taking a warm shower. I am glad to know, though, that these things do make an impact because I can focus on ways to lower my consumption like unplugging my charger when I'm done or trying to ride my bike downtown? (that is a maybe). At least I learned that consuming less will have a huge impact and may even lead me to feel happier. For chapter 14 I really liked to know there is a way to come together to defeat the crisis instead of relying on individual action. I think although people would be really angry at a carbon tax it would lower the amount of travel and bring down emissions. I also liked that the article showed what would improve if we slowed down on our fossil fuel consumption.

I think it's amazing that, by becoming a vegetarian, one can reduce their carbon emissions by about 1500 kg of CO2 per year. If you think about it, this is a very small change that can be implemented in almost anyone’s life with little to no pushback and with a great impact on the environment.  I think that these statistics need to be emphasized whenever environmentalists attempt to convert the american public over to becoming more climate-conscious in their diet because, when dependable statistics are emphasized, you don’t really need to be good at convincing people to do something-the numbers speak for themselves.
  <br><br>

I also really like the fact that Peter Kalmus concisely stated the 5 things that he did which majorly reduce his carbon emissions (“quitting planes, vegetarianism, bicycling, freegan, and composting”). If we ever want to bring the American public over to the idea that becoming an environmentally-friendly country is a feasible plan, we must convince them that there are only a few, minor (by minor, I mean not completely uprooting their family lives) changes that they must make in their lives. Otherwise, no one will ever be convinced to change their lifestyles because everyone will believe that it is “super difficult” to change their consumerist ways. Also,  if we are to make the whole American public attempt to become “greener”, it may be a good idea to have a law stating that every family unit must do at least ONE thing on this list  (“quitting planes, vegetarianism, etc.) in order to not be fined.
  <br><br>

The average American spends over $6,000 annually on new stuff. This is absolutely insane. Why can’t our society seem to take the fact that Americans are rampant consumers seriously? This is not normal and if we want to survive climate change we need to stop rampant capitalism IMMEDIATELY.

After reading this week’s “Leaving Fossil Fuel” and “Collective Action” from Peter Kalmus’ “Being the Change” I have a reinvigorated hope for climate change combat. Even after reading the number heavy passages I was inspired by the clean layout of facts and figures. I realized that there are actual people and organizations putting time and effort in researching as well as organizing protest. I believe all of these segments are needed in order to raise awareness about the climate crisis. We need science and mathematics in order to have clear direction on how to disinstall GHG emitters and understand the chemical disruption occurring in land, air and sea. We need historians and writers to effectively and accurately write to the public so that they understand just how drastic the climate change problem really is. We need teachers to educate children and the future generations so that they don’t repeat the same problems. We need the public to be educated in order to sway policy makers into making the necessary change. We need students, artists and activists to inspire people all across the globe with their creativity and passion. Its a circle of unity that is necessary in order to enact change.

I for one am not necessarily the type to sit down and read through pages and pages of facts, so I also really appreciated how the chapters were organized and straight to the point. Educating not only young people, but people that don't necessarily believe are crucial if we really want to turn our planet around.


<br><hr>
I agree with you. Also after reading "Leaving Fossil Fuel" and "Being the Change", I have way more hope for this movement. This was probably one of my favorite readings this class. Big corporations try and make it seem like there are less people on our side than there actually are. I was happy to see more spotlight shone on the people/organizations, like you said, putting time and effort in their research/organization. On top of everyone supporting the movement through their changed lifestyles, we do need these specialists that can forward the movement drastically through their efforts. Having these mathematicians, historians, and teachers on our side really makes our efforts more realistic and not in vain. We can all put in more effort to be more environmentally conscious through our diets, spending habits, and states of minds. I'm hopeful that this course can actually make me make change in my life, instead of forgetting everything I've learned.

I found the readings this week very rewarding. While I thoroughly enjoyed both, I would like to focus on the “Leaving Fossil Fuels” reading. Peter Kalmus talks about his three reasons for reduction. I found the first reason to be the most compelling: the reward. The importance of living a simpler lifestyle in order to focus on the more important things. This is important to me. I have always enjoyed the times with my family that are the most simple, sitting outside, hiking, playing a board game, I feel like this is a sign. A few years ago my mom's health took a bad turn. While it was scary and surprising because we are so close I think it changed all of our lives. We have all changed our diets and began to exercise and go on more “adventures” as we call them. It’s amazing what getting outside for a few hours can do for one's body and soul. We did this for the sake of our health as a family. We made lifestyle changes that we have stuck too and it has brought us all closer and changed our dynamic for the better. I know that the Kalmus family took their changes to much more of an extreme, and had a different motivation, so I can’t imagine how rewarding the feeling is. I found this truly inspiring. We all take life for granted but when you take a step back and realize all you have it's the people you are closest to that mean the most. So make the necessary lifestyle changes not only for the planet but for those you love and for future generations.

I was very grateful for the opportunity to engage with more of Peter Kalmus’ work. I already enjoyed the film “Being the Change” and it was valuable to get a more comprehensive look at the book it was based on. Peter’s expertise as a climate scientist gives him a lot of credibility and helps the reader better understand the significance and impact of their individual actions on our climate. 
  <br><br>
I also thought it was meaningful that Kalmus included a chapter on collective action. Because individual action is important, but alone it is not enough, and Kalmus recognizes this within the first sentence of the chapter. One of the overarching themes of this class has been that there needs to be a great political and social change in order for us to achieve our climate goals, and remain under the 2 degree limit. Kalmus points out there needs to be an economic incentive, a carbon tax or cap and trade policy. These are two policies I learned about in my Environmental Economics class last quarter. It’s very sensible to view climate change as an economic problem, the benefits we take today will lead to untold costs in the future. Therefore we need to assess the relative costs and benefits, and make valuable changes, through collective action, that account for the negative externalities our climate faces.

Before even watching Ken’s video for this week's reading, I was already planning on talking about my role as a UCSB student in the climate crisis. When reading (and also watching) “Being the Change”, I loved how Peter used every resource he could to emit less carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The one thing that was really impressive to me was how he was able to use a car that runs on vegetable oil! Although I loved how Peter was living his life, and seemed so happy doing it, proving that there wasn’t as much sacrifice to the riches in his life, I feel so helpless because I cannot live that environmentally friendly when I live on campus. I think about this issue especially with the dining commons… yes, I do eat mainly vegetarian and vegan as much as I can, but I have no idea how they make that food and they are also making a lot of animal products anyways and by me not eating them does not mean that that meat will go to waste. I don’t know, I just wish that the university could make more environmentally friendly choices so that the students living here can know that they are not contributing to the climate crisis.

Your comment about the dining commons reminded me of a similar situation I was in. I used to work at a cafe and right around the same time I started learning about the effects of animal agriculture and was transitioning to a vegan diet, but when I saw how many sandwiches and salads the cafe produced (and wasted) I began to feel pessimistic and doubtful. I thought along the same lines as you, “even if I become vegan they will still produce all of these animal products,” but as I’ve come to learn, one person does make a difference. In class today, someone made a comment that eating establishments usually do listen to what the customers want in terms of demand and will provide a product if they think many people will buy it, therefore, we should continue to eat plant-based to show a desire for plant-based foods. This notion comes to mind when considering how accessible vegan alternatives are here in California. It makes it super easy to be vegan, but I thank the vegans in the past who created the demand and allowed more vegan food to be on the shelves of grocery stores and as a menu item in restaurants. I do understand your concern about the meat going to waste. Although eating plant-based is important, so is reducing food waste. Because of this, the other diets Ken has mentioned are a good option to consider like being climatarian or flexitarian. Overall though, I think the labels matter less than just being mindful about what you’re eating. That in turn, can turn into more change without restrictions.

I enjoyed reading the two chapters from the book "Be The Change". In the chapter "Leaving Fossil Fuel" it explains the shift in lifestyle and character that one undergoes when reducing fossil fuel emissions. Peter undergoes changes in his life that affect him mentally in many ways. For some people, reducing carbon emissions makes them feel better about their impact in life and removes guilt from them. This chapter continued to talk about the ways Peter reduces his carbon footprint by reducing his use of technology and transportation. In the chapter "Collective Action" it talks about new approaches to solving the climate crisis. This chapter offered more new information that hasnt been covered yet in the course. It discusses two previous treaties the US implemented, but both have failed to fix the problem. They both served as good starting points and offered new techniques to reducing carbon emissions. Another thing I found interesting in this article is was the carbon fee. This seemed to be a smart resolution and would be a better alternative to the carbon tax. These chapters left me thinking about further ways we could reduce our carbon footprint while still staying mentally healthy.

I really enjoyed reading these 2 chapters from Peter Kalmus book. I feel like his point about not thinking about our individual changes as nonexistent in the grand scheme of things but as ways to improve our lives was very insightful and I definitely can relate to that point. When I took English 22 I just kept feeling like what's the point? Making individual lifestyle changes seemed useless and hopeless against major corporations. But Peter is right, reducing our addiction to fossil fuels and interacting more with one's community sounds like a much better way to live.
  <br><br>
I also really like how he broke down his life into a pie chart of Co2 emissions and then broke it down on how he would reduce them and how we could reduce ours.

  <br><br>

Peter’s carbon fee idea also sounds amazing. However, I can’t help but wonder, what's the point of a fee if the rich can easily pay it. I mean just look at Jeff Bezos, spending $16,00 in just parking tickets! Paying this fee would mean nothing to them but everything to some people which would then make the fee become unfavorable. I realize though that this seems like the most plausible solution and sometimes we just have to live with the fact that the 1% can get away with a lot of things. Peter’s idea about wealth redistribution although a pipe dream would be an amazing thing. There is no reason for these people to own some much while others own so little especially because the reason they own so much is because they exploit others.

In the chapter of “Leaving Fossil Fuel” from the book “Being the Change,” just like Ken said in his lecture, Peter Kalmus not only provided various detailed personal actions which all the people can practice in their daily lives but also offer the results of these actions to the audience. This helps the public to know what actions they can and need to take to stop the climate crisis effectively. First of all, when Kalmus talks about the aspect of air travel, he mentions that there are only 5 percent of people who have ever traveled by air globally. Also, the average American emits about one thousand kilograms of carbon dioxide just by flying per year. Combining with all of these facts, the audience can recognize that to reduce their carbon footprint dramatically, they need to stop, or at least reduce their air travel. Furthermore, the author also provided some consequences of this action: academic experts usually travel to different colleges and conferences to discuss the researches they have done with others. By stopping fly, their funding and job offers will be reduced. Other than air travel, Kalmus also presented plenty of other issues such as food productions, electricity, wastes, and so on, which all can be achieved and improved by personal actions.
  <br><br>

Other than personal actions, Kalmus also offered how people need to act together to accomplish in the chapter “Collective Action” of his book. The method of “Cap-and-Trade” which “the total emissions are capped, polluters trade carbon permits and the market sets price” is introduced by the author, following its problem of it’s complicated, expensive, speculate and exploit market and so on. Moreover, as Ken mentioned in his lecture, Kalmus compared the global warming as a market failure, saying that “burning fossil fuels impose huge costs on society that aren’t included in the price of the fuels, primarily by causing global warming and respiratory illness.”
  <br><br>

People should take action, in both personal and collective ways, to prevent the climate crisis as soon as possible. In my opinion, by utilizing the methods which Kalmus mentioned in his book “Being the Change,” people can protect the environment in more effective ways.

I also liked the two chapters we got to read from "Being the Change". I really appreciated in the chapter "Leaving Fossil Fuel" that Kalmus explained how he calculated his carbon footprint and explained how he made changes. Each of us only has so much time and energy that we can devote to lifestyle changes so I appreciated that Kalmus took on the bigger and more impactful changes first. I also like that Kalmus showed that he was having a negative impact on the environment and then he decided to change it. All too often these environmental films and readings make the focus on someone who already has it all figured out, who has already made those changes. By including his pre-change numbers in the first chapter, Kalmus really highlighted that almost anyone can make the lifestyle changes that he made.
   <br><br>

I also thought the chapter "Collective Action" was very very important. Climate change is a problem that is caused by larger scale societal action, so we need to start treating it that way. We need individual action of course, but we also need to realize that collective action is necessary as well. I thought that this chapter did a great job of highlighting the tragedy of the commons too. Sure, if I don't get on a plane, it may very well still take flight, but what about 300 people? Think about all the planes that could stay grounded if we simply flew less or not at all, and think about how much CO2 that would prevent from going into the atmosphere. 
   <br><br>

On a final note I appreciate this chapter because it made me own up to my own cognitive dissonance. Being an out of state student I fly home semi-regularly. Before this class I knew that air travel was not environmentally ideal, but I had no idea how bad it was for the environment. With spring break coming up, I had the decision to either take the plane or the train home. Now the train takes a lot longer than flying, 29 hours compared to 2. So I decided to fly but I also decided to pay a carbon offset, sort of how they did in the documentary "Before the Flood ''. But Kalmus detailed exactly why these carbon offsets are not the greatest option and that they serve as a way to defend flying, rather than actually solving the problem. I immediately felt naive and guilty and tried to refund my plane ticket but with no luck. Long story short, this flight home will be the last flight I take for a long time and I will implement slow travel into my life.

By reading the text, I realize that personal action can really affect the environment with less carbon emission. And it is way more understandable than the movie Being The Change, since I do not get the point of the huge amount shots of meditation scenes. I feel his idea when he is talking about the happiness and it got me related to the movie we saw for the last week Happiness. It says when people release less carbon dioxide, they become much happier. Why? They do not need to worry to live in a planet that will be not suitable for human years after. Quite agree with the idea. I think that it is absolutely necessary for human to draw down the emission for greenhouse gas, if we want to tell our offspring that they do not need to worry about the planet’s future. Sustainable living will be one of the effective living styles in the future for one hundred percent sure from my point of view. If people still do not want to do something to save the environment, I think they may have no time to explain the situation in the future to their children about how they do nothing to the planet.

Reading these chapters of "being the change" was really great. Having watched the film, it was nice to see Peter Kalmus approach the Climate Crisis more broadly and talk about what others can do to help limit their emissions. The film was very focused on his personal life, and while that was great, it was harder to see what I could do as a college student. Like Ken said, this reading was pretty similar to Project Drawdown, but I think it was even better. It was informative, but also appealed to my humanity because Kalmus repeatedly touched on his own life. Kalmus proves that changes can be made and that they can make a huge impact. Also, to see the emissions of various behaviors -- like eating, driving, etc. -- put into actual numeric values was really important. The fact that the average US diet emits almost 3,000 tonnes of emissions is crazy and is a lot more influential than just saying that eating a lot of meat is bad for the environment. If it wasn't clear before, this reading shows just how powerful personal action is. And after personal action, it is important to join together with larger environmental movements.

I agree with your comment. The reading nicely supplemented what we had already learned about Kalmus through the film, and it was much easier to follow because of that. Moreover, the suggestions he had for introducing environmentally friendly alternatives into our lives were all more practical than previous ones we have encountered in this class, and the fact that he lives a life that is not so different from the common American's proved that they are all things that we can bring into our daily lives without having to give up much of our freedom.
  <br><br>
Peter Kalmus, despite favoring personal action, also encourages and stresses the importance of collective activism, and I think your comment does a good job of showing the impact and significance of both.



<br><hr>
Like you Julia, I really do feel myself believing in the power of personal action more and more when it comes to climate change. I feel like its easy to be like "oh go vote, and that's where the biggest difference can be made." Yes, this is true. Let's say that over the next five years, the Green New Deal becomes implemented, and we begin to see the forced societal changes towards a more environmentally friendly future. This all sounds amazing and good, but realistically  its going to cause a massive uproar among those who are ignorant and intimidated by the topic of climate change. Change in it of itself is intimidating. People like Peter Kalmus and their sharp ideals and lifestyles are going to be the relatable (somewhat) role model we will look towards. The power to motivate others to change is easier than just an economic motivation; we need to make it, not only cool, but a viable option to shift towards a greener lifestyle. 
  <br><br>

Peter Kalmus's movie "Being the Change" felt a lot more impactful being exposed to it a second time. I was reaffirmed in my ability to make a difference individually with small changes to my life. I work out and when you are lifting free weights in an effort to gain strength and or build muscle, there's a concept of progressive overload: consistent increasing the resistance little by little, with changed variable, will eventually lead to growth. Consistency is key in that buildup and the same applies to reducing carbon emissions. It amazes me at the amount how much change in my own carbon footprint I can make just by tweaking small things like the clothesline example or focusing in on a more plant heavy diet. Over time, like the gym, these changes add up towards a greater reduction against one's carbon footprint. Just don't forget, consistency is key. 
  <br><br>

These chapters and class as a whole have really opened my mind to how i want to form my lifestyle in my twenties and as a build a family in the future. I wish this kind of thinking and movement was more available 30-40 years ago so that maybe now my parents raised me with such thinking. However, there is still time to use this knowledge and hindsight and be the change.



<br><hr>
I agree with you. Reading chapters of "being the change" is very provoking. Actual numerical values are important. It provides us with a scale to estimate the influence of our personal action. Just like the numerical grading system, these numbers can make us understand the impact clearly and make the statement more valid. It is true, as you said, that "the fact that the average US diet emits almost 3,000 tonnes of emissions is crazy and is a lot more influential than just saying that eating a lot of meat is bad for the environment." The latter is too broad and less convincing. And the former uses the number "3,000 tonnes of emissions" to specify the influence with a scale, which makes the statement more convincing. Thus, the reading presents how influential personal action is by using a numerical scale. And, when we sum the effect of each individual, we are powerful enough to make the change.



<br><hr>

Hey, Julia! I totally agree with your viewpoint on numeric value part. The most impressive part for the two chapters are those numeric numbers as those numbers are a simple intuitive way to enable me realize how much greenhouse gases I am generating now, per day!  Let’s take meat consumption v.s vegetable consumption as an example. Merely saying shifting eating habits from meat to vegetable will greatly reduce the emission of greenhouse gases is not persuasive enough in that we do not know the extent of emission reduction generated via the change. In contrast, numeric numbers can directly inform individuals about the amount of CO2 or equivalent gases generated by them via consuming per meal. What’s more, it provides a straightforward comparison to enable the public find out the large difference between the two different consumption habit by clearly pointing out the amount of emission each option will produce.  Then, whether or not to continuously consume meat will depend on the readers.
  <br><br>

As for the rest of these two chapters, I really into the beginning sentence of the chapter 14 “Climate change is a result of the greatest failure the world has seen”. Market failure is a word I used to learn in the economic class: an inefficient distribution of goods and services in the free market. In market failure, the individual incentives for rational behavior do not lead to rational outcomes for the group. The rise of the technology is the cause and the climate change is the result. Let’s take airplanes as an example. Admittedly, airplanes rises our living standard. We used to spend months to reach United States from China via taking ships. In contrast, within the reach of airplanes, we could reach U.S in merely 14 hours. How convenient it is! However, airplanes is one of the major culprits to increase the earth temperature. Since we are used to it, even we realize the harmful effects generated by those airplanes, we could not get rid of them. Nevertheless, there are a lot of innocent people who do not take airplanes. They have to embrace those harmful effects with us, which is unfair to them.

This reading by Peter Kalmus was exactly what I needed at this point in my life. Similarly to Kalmus, I first heard about climate change in elementary school. I continued to learn about it almost every year up until this very day. Personally, I have given up eating beef completely and hope to one day stop eating meat completely. I know there are many other things in my life I could change, like stopping myself from purchasing unnecessary products and creating more waste, but I haven’t been able to bring myself to do it. Now I understand why. As Kalmus acknowledges, learning about climate change can be a lot to take in. It’s easier to deny the facts than accept the harsh reality of climate change. I often times find myself feeling guilty when I do things that I know will add to my carbon footprint or produce waste etc., but that’s all. I don’t vow to change then and there because of how I feel. Kalmus rightfully calls guilt an “insincere self apology.” Using guilt and fear as mechanisms to communicate the climate crisis do not mobilize people, it shuts them down. I like the authors approach of “Head, Hands and heart.” If we are passionate about something, it can be fun to explore that thing. That’s the approach we have to take with Climate change. I also liked how in the second chapter, Kalmus brought up the slogan “save the planet.” I had never thought about how ironic this saying  is. At the end of the day, the planet is going to be fine. Humans are the ones who will face the consequences. The saying should be “Save us Humans.” We’ve grown so fond of this idea of human exceptionalism, the idea that we are not bound by nature. Rather, we need to change this mindset to an understanding that we depend on the biosphere just like every other species. Individual change is awesome. Kalmus compares individual change to a puzzle piece. However we cant only focus on our selves, we have to look at the bigger picture. The puzzle as a whole. As a collective, we are going to undergo various societal and physical changes. We all have to contribute and do our part or we will never find a community.

After reading two chapters in “Being the Change” by Peter Kalmus, I was quite inspired to make some lifestyle changes of my own. In the readings, Kalmus analyzed his own carbon footprint. Doing so brought about many revelations seeing as even after he made those changes, his carbon footprint was still greater than the average person in Bangladesh. This is extremely eye opening to me because it really shows how privileged we are. Even after trying to reduce his carbon footprint, he was not able to equate it to someone living their normal life in a developing country.  Additionally, Ken has previously stated poorer people and poorer countries will suffer from climate change more than the wealthy. It’s just ironic because wealthier countries and individuals contribute to climate change by emitting a significant amount of greenhouse gases. He stated in lecture that an average American is responsible for 16.4 metric tons of CO2 gases being emitted per year. Therefore, Americans are one of the main causes for climate change, but we’re unable to directly see its effects because of how privileged we are. Instead, those who have contributed little to nothing towards the climate crisis are the ones that are hurt the most. There is still hope to reverse this, however, as shown by Peter Kalmus. Changing our lifestyles obviously doesn’t happen overnight. However, I think that it’s a slow, developing transition into a healthier lifestyle not only for ourselves but for our planet. If we can start small, and work our way up, we can still reverse this. It’s a matter of putting in the work to enact action.

It really is eye-opening to see how much carbon emissions the average American is responsible for. It is hard for me to even visualize what 16.4 metric tons of something looks like. What I also liked during the Kalmus readings was how he offered some possible solutions and steps we could take to reduce our carbon footprint. The idea of a carbon fee is something that might actually work because it incentivizes companies and people to operate more environmentally friendly. Yes, it's going to be a slow transition for a majority of Americans, but I totally think that it's possible. Over the course of history, humans have adapted to many catastrophes with a quickness that our current climate crisis needs. As Kalmus said, collective action needs to happen for this to work.

It is great to learn about how exactly we can change the way we live for the planet and the numbers associated with the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Ken has repeatedly stated that we focus on the cultural change. I think personal change does make a difference on cultural change, since we all can help others conceive the change by changing ourselves in the first place. I really appreciate the section in “Leaving Fossil Fuel” where it teaches us how to calculate our own emissions. A lot of the articles we have read so far address a variety of numbers regarding emissions, and there are some authors that mentioned how much they (along with their families) have reduced. However, I had no idea how to estimate my own emission until I read the article, nor did I know what the numbers really represent. As someone who lives in the dorm, it is somehow difficult for me to do the calculations for things like natural gas and electricity, but at least the author has shown the readers some equations to begin with. 
  <br><br>


In the chapter “Collective Action”, the author mentions the idea of half-earth as a policy goal. The author keeps assuring the readers that the idea is not entirely impossible, because “just a few generations ago— not even a blink of geologic time—it would have seemed equally breathtaking to imagine that our species could so dominate this planet.” This idea is almost the complete opposite of the idea of the merging of country and cities, which was mentioned in a previous lecture by Ken. Personally I am on the side of a green metropolis, simply because I think it is more practical, and I have already seen some societies that adopt more of those practices. This is not to say that half-earth is impossible. I just think that at the moment perhaps a green metropolis is more favorable to start with, and maybe half-earth can be considered as a giant goal for the more distant future.

After watching the film, it's nice to see Peter calms explore the climate crisis more comprehensively and discuss what others can do as much as possible. This movie is centered on his own life. I think it's incredible. I'm more interested in understanding what I can do as an undergraduate. This is significant because it allows ordinary people (myself, for example) to truly grasp the harm we do to the planet. I think this part is an extraordinary close reading, because it describes Peter's own memory of how he, as a person, reduces his impact on the environment. However, what limits his nutrition and purchases is almost a downward look.
  <br><br>
The main way to involve individuals in change is, first of all, continuous change. I really respect his activities, and I agree that we need more people, whether they see themselves as activists or not, to change in every aspect of their daily lives.
  <br><br>
This book makes people realize that practicing environmental safety does not mean being a vegetarian forever. In Peter's case, the biggest impact he can have on the impression of reducing carbon emissions is to give up flying. After understanding this, I began to try to make some small improvements. Everyone is trying to make their life more satisfying, so if we have the opportunity to do that and further ensure our conditions, it is a win-win environment for success.

One of the things that really stood out to me from the reading was Maebe, the vegetable run oil car. It’s impressive to see how Peter was able to use his ingenuity to create an invention that doesn’t emit additional carbon where it begins running. I think this is so much more inspiring than mass produced electric cars which only have a measly contribution to a larger problem. Electric cars can take a huge toll on the environment through its production and assembly. Additionally, I can’t imagine that those massive batteries are environmentally viable either. While I don’t think everyone should drive an unreliable DIY car as an alternative, I think people should try to find ingenious and innovative ways to reduce their own carbon emission. 
  <br><br>

Peter’s dedication to constantly do better for the environment really stood out to me. I think that kind of commitment is necessary for everyone if significant changes were to be made. Society should look for a single, all encompassing solution to climate  change. Instead, we I think it would be much more productive to strive for persistent action and changes to better the environment.

Well said; I think that Maebe was perhaps the most fun part of the reading by a mile. While electric cars are a step up from a hummer, they do still pose significant costs on our environment, and a car like Maebe that literally runs on vegetable oil is the best alternative. It's a change that very few people ever even consider, let alone have the scientific know how to make happen. I agree with you that innovative and creative solutions to everyday problems in individual's lives are the most important things that we can all do as a collective right now.
  <br><br>
Kalmus is a fantastic role model for how to reduce your carbon footprint in a western-centric way. He is not only brilliant on the topic (obviously) but he walks the walk and is not bitter or holier-than-thou about it, he is a genuine person who believes that he can make an impact, and that he is happier when he's making these positive steps towards being carbon-neutral.


<br><hr>
I so agree that Peter is clearly a creative man that is willing to think outside the box in order to uphold his ideals for change. People keep making new innovations, which are good and all, but at the end of the day is any of this really viable? A few years down the line are we going to look at Project Drawdown and see these devices added to the list? It's going to be people like Peter, who are creative enough to look outside of the box and make that change, the one he talks to passionately for. Maybe there's even some fun in playing around with ways in which to fix this global problem, it doesn't have to feel like a chore. Take that pride in making something that can save the world.

What I really liked about this reading was that Peter Kalmus really tries to make readers self aware of their actions. Through the telling of his own self awareness and change, he tries to promote that self awareness in his readers through methods such as quantification, even providing a chart so readers can estimate their own carbon footprint. This reading details so many things that create CO2 emissions, many that we have talked about in class, and some new ones that I was unaware of. He details things in daily life that create CO2 emissions, such as showering, laundry, pilot lights, laptops, etc. Although the numbers are not as significant as things like flying, they are things that we should keep in mind. Again, flying is brought up in this reading, showing just how much flying can affect someone’s climate footprint. Another thing I really liked about this reading was the fact that Kalmus used numbers to quantify emissions. With the numbers, things are really put into perspective with one another and it is easy to see the great impact of some of these actions (such as flying and driving) had on carbon emissions. 
   <br><br>
In the second chapter we read, Kalmus talks about collective action. Among the many ideas he talked about, one that I found interesting was carbon taxes and cap and trade, concepts I am also learning about in economics right now. I was not aware of the possible consequences, such as exploitation, expensive energy, and the disincentive of emission reductions, making it the lesser of the two options. Carbon tax/fees have less possible consequences involved, making it the better choice for government intervention. I think a carbon tax is definitely something that the government should start implementing, as it forces firms to internalize the negative externalities that its carbon emissions have on society. In the case of actions with negative externalities, placing a tax on the action will increase the overall revenue of the market for society, demonstrating how carbon taxes can have a positive benefit not just environmentally, but economically.

I was really impressed by Peter Kalmus’s writing style. He managed to strike an important balance between conveying the urgency and necessity of solving this issue while not coming across as too “preachy” or elitist. That skill is incredibly important because its so easy to get lost in the minutia and complexity and end up turning off a large portion of your audience. In spite of not using technical jargon, Kalmus retained his “ethos” and came across as very informed and worth listening to. A lot of this credibility likely derived from Kalmus’s use of accurate data tracking and the alignment of his words and actions. It’s much easier to convince someone to take an issue seriously when they see you taking steps to accomplish that goal yourself. Another aspect of the book that was especially persuasive was how Kalmus explained that he doesn’t view the transition to a sustainable life as having to “give up” something for the greater good. Rather, he enjoys living in a more modest and eco-friendly manner. This idea reminded me of Thoreau in Walden and how he described the enjoyment he got from living more simply. Although I, by no means, live similarly to Thoreau or Kalmus, a lot of my best memories from my life have no required consumption or fossil fuel intensive activities. For example, hiking in Yosemite with my friends, longboarding in IV, playing spikeball on the beach. All of these activities were more rewarding to me than anything I could buy with money. And as I’ve mentioned earlier, living in a tiny dorm with my roommate was actually more enjoyable (and nearly as functional) as living my much larger house at home. I think as more people adopt Kalmus’s ideas, it will hopefully destigmatize living in smaller homes and having smaller, less luxurious, cars. Although having a house with extra guest rooms and tons of extra room and fancy amenities is convenient and may make your life easier, there is something rewarding about doing things yourself. As Kalmus likes to point out, you can’t solve everything with technology… and that's coming from an astrophysicist.

While reading "Be The Change", it gave me a flashback to all the things my mom wanted to do once it was just me and her in the house: get rid of all the stuff we don't need. We had so many clothes, items, trinkets, etc. that there was no purpose in having them at all. We began to change the way we buy and consume stuff, we don't buy what we don't need and a lot of the stuff we do buy is from Thrift stores or hand-me-downs from our families. But even though this action of minimalism is only a fraction of our carbon footprint, it is a good first step. Just reading what Peter's choices are for him and his family to live is just inspiring, so much so that I want to start doing the things he is doing, such as growing his own garden and riding a bike to and from places.

   <br><br>

In UCSB, I get to do some of those things that I have always wanted to do to lower my carbon footprint. From taking the bus everywhere to practicing having a plant-based diet, to walking around IV to being more cautious of what I throw away or recycle. Even though I am not part of the 1%, I understand that I am in a country that is so heavily privileged that it hurts. So it is my responsibility to use that privilege to change the way my life is run and how this country should run. You may think that personal action only affects you, but because of your action, you can and will influence someone to do the same thing. So lets started influencing others to rethink their habits, tell them about what Peter did with composting and gardening, tell them about the need to stop flying so much, tell them how healthy and helpful biking is to decrease your carbon footprint. YOU can make a difference for yourself and for everyone else around you.

My family loves to donate old clothes and items that we don't need. My dad always tells me that less is more, and I fully agree with him. I hate buying things I don't need. I often wish for American life to slow down and be more appreciative, but people are too selfish for that right now.

After reading "Being the Change" I realized that reducing my carbon emissions isn't as hard as it may seem. For example, I think I've already reduced my carbon emissions because I didn't bring a car to campus, so I bike or walk everywhere I need to go. Even on the breaks we've had from school I've found that I've carpooled more or walked to places relatively close to my house. I wouldn't even say that it was a conscious thing, but since I'm so used to walking to places on campus, places that are even further then those at home, walking to for example the nail spa didn't seem that daunting. Another thing that I've done but didn't know howe big of a deal it was is also choosing to dry a lot of my clothes. I wasn't aware of how bad dryers were for the environment, and yet my family and I hang dry a lot of clothes mainly because the dryer is just too damaging. Ever since this class I've also found myself attempting to thrift clothing more, and telling my sister and friends that thrifting is so much more sustainable and ethical than supporting fast fashion and sweat shops. The little things that I have either been doing for a while or recently started doing are things that are so reasonable that everyone should be able to do it, and the benefits far outweigh the costs or extra effort they may require.

I agree with you completely! Before college I used to drive to every destination, but in college I walk everywhere, which I realize reduces my carbon emission by a lot since cars emit a lot of CO2. On the breaks I prefer to walk or bike rather then drive because after months of not driving, driving now makes me carsick. I have also started to consume less meat than before, because meat is expensive and as a broke college student I can not afford that; this however only serves to reduce my carbon emission even more compared to when I lived back at home. Reducing carbon emissions seems harder than it really is, and everyone should try to reduce their carbon emission. Thinking that personal reduction does not make an impact is a misconception, Kalmus brings up the idea of "shifting cultures" through personal reduction. There is no good reason against trying to reduce carbon emission.

This week’s readings were really interesting and inspiring. Peter Kalmus in his chapters  “Leaving Fossil Fuel”  and “Collective Action” made it seem like changing for the better of the climate is a real possibility if we all work together. I liked how he mentioned so many different ways in which we could contribute to lowering emissions. From the list he made of top contributors, I wasn’t surprised at all at seeing acts like flying, and eating meat up there, but I didn’t expect things like turning off lights to be a great enough impact. Obviously if we tackle the biggest issues, it’d be way better for our environment, but just starting somewhere is important. We have the resources and capability of creating change, that other nations don’t have the privilege to do so. The way Kalmus writes how harmful our actions are inspires us to want to make change. For example, he mentions that quitting planes would save us from adding an extra 16,500kg of CO2 to the environment. 5% of humans have flown planes and this small number is causing the most harm to the planet. Those numbers alone are unbelievable but people should start seeking alternatives to their daily lives. Also Ken mentioned that the average American spends about $6,000 a year on new things. This is another issue that needs solving as a majority of people just spend and spend, but in the end not even use half of these items. All these different issues are harmful in many ways to the planet, but through collective action many of this can be reduced for the well-being of the planet.

It is so true that during the reading I find it really enjoyable. This writer is very positive, energetic, and optimistic, during his writing, he easily takes people into his atmosphere and talk about little things that everyone can relate to, which makes everyone be proud of themselves and be willing to do more to “being the change”. In China, people always dry their clothes under natural sunlights, so do people in Europe, it might take longer periods of time to wait, but it does save a large amount of energy. Also in Ken’s video, Ken carefully gives us the accurate data that people can do to reduce the pollution in every kind of way so people can know how environment can be saved better.

I thought Peter Kalmus’ life experiment was insightful and an important read for this course. His book “Being the Change,” offers a more personal and in-depth analysis on how we can achieve a reduction in our personal emissions while also leading a happy life. Throughout chapter 9, Kalmus covered a lot of what we learned in class. Planes are very bad for our carbon footprint and if someone dedicated their whole life to be vegan and bike to work everyday, just one plane flight could completely offset all of their efforts. I found the statistics on food dieting particularly interesting. The fact that a meat diet releases 3 metric tons of CO2 or other equivalent gases is surprising taking into consideration that we should only be emitting 2 metric tons per year. What was even more astonishing to me is the fact that having a vegetarian diet and a vegan diet is not that different in respects to emissions as a vegetarian diet emits 1,500 kg of CO2 and a vegan diet emits 1,000 kg of CO2. This means that it would be more efficient and better for the world if everyone cut down on the amount of meat they eat rather than converting to vegetarianism and veganism. I also found Kalmus’ engagement with being a freegan as insightful and interesting. When we learned about what being a freegan was last week, I thought it was a little weird and couldn’t see it actually being a reliable way to get food. After learning about Kalmus’ accomplishments, I have much more hope and am more interested in engaging with being a freegan myself. Then note about the pilot lights were surprising and something I would never have considered if I had not read about it in this chapter. This is a scary thought because there could be things around us that is increasing our carbon footprint by a significant amount but we fail to realize that it is right next to us. 
    <br><br>
Chapter 14 was about collective action and the most interesting part of this chapter for me was when Peter Kalmus explains what the CFAD is. The documentary from last week touched upon the Carbon fee and dividend, but it didn’t really explain how it worked. In this chapter, I thought Kalmus did a fantastic job explaining the CFAD and selling it as an effective method to start shifting the world and economy towards a direction that will mitigate the climate crisis. I agree with Kalmus that the concentration of wealth in our nations is a huge barrier in passing policies that will prevent more emissions. This is because wealth is being used in politics to prevent politicians from supporting the climate crisis. I liked how in this chapter, Kalmus not only supports and provides evidence for the CFAD, but he also offers other solutions and points out why the CFAD remains superior. There were also some pretty radical and crazy ideas towards the end of his chapter. For example, he advocates “Half-Earth” where half of the earth is dedicated to wildlife. This in theory would work as overpopulation is one of the main causes as to why the world is degenerating, but it is also a radical and unlikely solution. Theories like these are ones that I do not agree on because they fall really close to Malthusiasm and can easily devolve into much darker ideas on population control. Overall, I found the read an insightful and hopeful message that I too can cut down my emissions by a factor of 10 and live a happy life.

Having readings/videos on Peter twice now has been quite interesting as he offers a perspective from someone who actually takes action in order to cut his carbon footprint, as well is scientifically inclined and knowledgeable so he can gauge how effective his methods are as well as even test new ways all while explaining to readers or viewers his journey. His explanation and documenting of his methods are very useful as they serve as both entertainment and inspiration for viewers to take action themselves and show them how effective some small steps can be. Peter had some cool methods such as converting a diesel fuel car into a car that runs purely on vegetable oil thus making it emit 0 Co2. However methods like these are not very practical to learn from when you’re a college student like me or a normal person with limited resources. Nonetheless his other methods were as effective and practical as they have inspired me to take action and spread these ideas with my family and friends. I am moving to eliminate all air travel as I never really travel far regardless and the negative impact it has is just too immense to be worth it especially during times like these. I am also working to eliminate driving my car, even though I have already stopped this greatly since moving to college, but i’ve always loved biking and doing it for every form of local transportation may become burdening, it is a great workout and Peter has proved it to be quite effective in lowering one’s carbon footprint.
   <br><br>


There are tons of other ways to keep moving forward in reducing one’s carbon footprint and helping combat climate change on a personal level like even converting to veganism as well as even veganism. I feel as if while we are students, we are in a first world country and majority of us are not struggling for resources, so it is important for those of us who are able to, to pick and choose options in our daily life that are more eco friendly. As we each take small steps to make a change, together we can make one big change and Peter’s works prove this entirely.

I like how “Leaving Fossil Fuel” started with the author’s realization of what changes he could make in his life to leave a smaller carbon footprint. Improving the earth (lowering carbon footprints) is truly about comprehension AND recognizing that many actions humans take within our daily lives impacts the environment. Since we’ve already covered the effect of air travel, car travel, food/food waste, and consumerism, it was nice to see the statistics that correlated with them. It’s pretty insane that air travel is the #1 contributor to one’s carbon footprint, yet the environmental effects of this CO2 is short term. This means that taking out/reducing air travel from our lives would definitely help lower our carbon footprints, as well as maintain a cleaner atmosphere. 
   <br><br>

Kalmus’ three reasons to reduce fossil fuels were because it is enjoyable, it shows you take action towards something you are aware about, and it creates a shift in cultural norms. With this, the main thing I struggle with is practicing what I preach. Although I don’t always verbally encourage people to make shifts in their lifestyles, I still am knowledgeable on what the average human lifestyle does to the environment. Personally, out of all the topics Kalmus presented, I feel that I can make the biggest change within my consumer mentality. Like the majority of Americans, I was raised with the want to buy more and need more. One of my flaws is being a huge impulse buyer, especially when there are sales. This has resulted in me having piles of clothes, shoes, accessories, etc that I do not wear very often, or literally not at all. Now that I think about it, this contributes to waste, fast fashion, and several other topics we have covered in class. Diving deeper into the subject, when I read that one American’s trash contributes to more CO2 than the average Bangladeshi, I was actually ashamed. Ugh. I love consuming but I hate consumer culture! Like Kalmus said, we will all have different profiles for carbon emissions, and like I said, the biggest change I needed to make was my consumer mentality. 
   <br><br>

Reading “Collective Action” really just put the nail in the coffin for me in regards to what we as a community should do to take action. My favorite part of this chapter was the very end, where Kalmus made apparent that he was speaking from a human point of view, with human opinions on the matter. Then he went on to talk about how accepting and acknowledging the scientist's point of view is very important as well, for they are the people we should be listening to. Like he said, the job of a scientist is to look into the facts, and report such facts, so why wouldn’t we listen to them?

I too found it insane that if air travel were stopped the CO2 effects would be gone in s short period of time. Relating to today I  recently saw an article about how airlines are flying empty airplanes because they are worried their flight slots will be lost, whatever that means, because of the coronavirus. Point is capitalism, literally they are flying these ghost planes because of the money they are losing. Yet doing that is literally fucking us over with all these unnecessary flights thats are just adding to the air pollution in the atmosphere.

I struggle with practicing what I preach as well, I have told my entire family about what I’ve learned in class and telling them how we can change but at times I too go overboard with sales. I feel like growing up with this consumer mentality all around us is what makes things harder. Like I know what I have to do but it is really hard because most of the affordable things are what produce the most fossil fuel, or are companies that support these industries. 
   <br><br>
Reading chapter 14, was eye opening, we have discussed carbon taxes and fees but we haven't really gone into depth about it and what it would mean for the capitalistic world we live in. Having Kalmus’ scientific perspective is what made it even better because these are facts he is talking about. This whole chapter was just really interesting and I feel like if the government were to incorporate these plans we would be so much closer to doing something about the climate. We would all end up winning in the end and more people need to know about this so they can also get on board with the idea. We all just assume that because we are so dependent on fossil fuel anything else would be so much more pricey and we would be losing money changing to renewable but that isn't the case.

Hey Sydney, I could not agree more with your comment. It is truly about realizing and recognizing the huge impact of our actions on the planet. We have all heard that the first thing to fix a problem is to accept there is a problem. In this case, our cultural practices have only worsened over time and now we are running out of time to fix our mistakes. While there are some things that cannot be undone, such as the melting of the poles, we still have control over our everyday practices. For instance switching to a plant-based diet. 
   <br><br>
Peter Kalmus' reading clearly exposes the impact of our actions and made me double think about the aftermath. Nonetheless, this reading also taught me how much we can do to contribute more to mitigate the climate crisis. As a developed country, we are used to luxury and commodity; however, through Peter's journey we are able to see that a minimalistic life can easily fulfill the same necessities while also reducing our CO2 footprint.

After reading two chapters “Leaving Fossil fuel” and “Collective Action” from the book Being the Change by Peter Kalmus, I have some new ideas about climate change. Kalmus focuses on what each of us can do to reduce our own greenhouse gas emissions from the perspective of a climate scientist. According to Kalmus, when he became a vegetarian in 2012, his greenhouse gas emissions reduced. Kalmus not only underscores major issues related to greenhouse gas emissions, like cars and planes, but also shows how to take actions to reduce their impact on the climate. Kalmus mentions that using a clothesline would reduce household carbon dioxide emissions by 550 kilograms, which is equivalent to enormous amount of other things. Kalmus also mentions other accurate data to illustrate the importance of small actions in daily lives. In the future, I would like to take more actions to reduce my footprint on the environment.

I also felt enlightened after reading the two chapters from "Being the Change", by Peter Kalmus. While I thought Project Drawdown was very thorough and informative, the chapters from "Being the Change" were much more applicable in my own life. After becoming vegetarian and a freegan, Kalmus reduced his food emissions to .4 metric tons a year. To put this in perspective, the average American uses 3 metric tons of carbon for food each year. I was also purely disgusted by the emissions that come from each person's trash each year. Approximately 1300 kg of Co2 comes from landfills. This amount exceeds the amount a single person living in Bangladesh emits each year. 
   <br><br>

In all honesty, I never thought I would be so passionate about reducing my carbon footprint or "being the change". However, this class has given me a totally new perspective. Readings such as these two chapters have given me new light to the situation. Not only do they show me how dire the situation is, they also teach me easy ways I can make a difference in my day to day life. While I already have been vegetarian for 9 years, I am now seeking to adopt ways I can aid the planet even more. Kalmus explains that biking significantly reduced his emissions in the transportation sector. I am now more motivated to bike than ever. Lastly, I like how Kalmus discusses the psychological effects of reducing carbon. He explains its made him a happier person. I agree that when people are less supportive of consumeristic culture and lead simpler lifestyles, they can become more content with their life.
<br><hr>
I also found this reading intriguing due to the focus of what each of us can do to personally reduce our own greenhouse gas emissions. I enjoyed hearing these actions we can take from Kalamus because he was able to share about his own personal experiences. I know that when I personally read articles on climate change it's hard to relate to them because it doesn’t focus on real people taking action. Instead articles usually focus on scientific facts and this can often overwhelm people. I found it intriguing how Kalamus was able to incorporate his personal actions/life with scientific facts. I found it interesting to learn how much Kalamus was able to reduce his carbon footprint from simple actions being taken. For example, when Kalamus went vegetarian in 2012, he was able to reduce his footprint by 1500 kilograms of CO2 per year. Growing his own food also significantly lowered this number as well. While going vegetarian can be a big step for some people, doing something as simple as utilizing a clothes line can reduce your carbon footprint by 550 kilograms. With this being said, there is no excuse to not take action. We can start by doing simple things and move into bigger changes. I found it shocking when Kalamus presented facts at his readers because I was not aware of the stats. For example, the average American diet emits 2900 kilograms of CO2 per year which is 3 metric tons. This basically means your whole carbon allotment is blown. Another fact I found shocking was that landfills emit 1300 kilograms of CO2 per person per year. This means that one person’s trash generates more CO2 than the average person in Bangladesh. Reading about these facts honestly made me sad and really made me question if we can actually reduce these numbers as a whole. Although we are progressing towards making a huge change, I still think there are a handful of people who are not willing to make a change for the world.

In the reading “Leaving Fossil Fuel” and “Collective Action”, I have taught some ways to both individually and collectively address climate change. Even before reading the article, I realized that car use definitely plays a major rule in one’s carbon emission. And that is why I asked my parents to reconsider the decision to buy another vehicle, even an electric one. Because of the long commuting time my parents have on their way to work places every morning, they have decided to buy another car. As in China, buying electric car can get a subsidy. They told me that they would purchase an electric one. However, I said no as soon as they told me the decision, as well as the reason-the cost on carbon emission. As first, they did not think that it is a big deal. After watching the video I recommended to them, they have realized the importance of not buying another car.

I understand what you mean. Cars that run on fossil fuel are bad enough as they are. And if we want to switch to an electric car, it would still contribute some carbon footprint. This is where the implementation of bicycling everywhere would come into play. If it's necessary, an electric car would be best to travel if you have to travel to work that's pretty far. However, using a bike would be the best option. I actually like the idea that Ken stated before, which is using an electric bike. Even the more elderly would be able to use it.


<br><hr>
I think the point you bring up is interesting- that if we wanted to switch to electric cars, we would still be leaving some sort of carbon footprint which contributes to GHG emissions in the most ironic way. To say if this would be successful in the long run, who knows? But times like this call for desperate measures, and maybe we should just entirely focus on only reducing our automobile use and switching to other forms of transportation-a topic and idea that has been resurfaced time and time again through this course. My favorite, and seemingly most fun method would be the electric bike that Ken brought up. My parents own one and I know they love using it for short trips to the grocery store where they would've otherwise driven.

Through Eng23, Ken taught us a lot of facts about the climate crisis, and mostly Ken telling us what we can do now is being the change. As the two chapters in "Being the change" says, burning fossil fuels release great amount of greenhouse gases and some actions have been taken such as paying carbon fees. A lot of countries in the world are still using fossil fuels for producing electricity, natural gas, and available sources we need for everyday. Too many natural resources on the Earth are exploit by human beings, and this process emits great amount of greenhouse gases which increases the climate footprint. 
   <br><br>
I believe my generation is flexible to make a change, but it is a little bit different for my parents and grandparents to understand the current situation. They may know the climate change based on the environment they are living in such as the air pollution and global warming. However, they don't realize specifically what they should do to lower the climate footprint. My parents own a car, sometimes they drive to work. They do online shopping because it is more convenient and time-saving. Actually I have several suggestions for them on what they can do on helping to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. For example, taking public transportations, consuming less beef, and buying less unneeded stuff. I also need to persuade them to make a change and tell them the current situation of the climate crisis. If people at all ages can gather together into a carbon reduction life, the Earth and our future can be saved.

Most of Peter Kalmus’ personal actions taken towards the environment were things we have discussed heavily in this class. These included: stopping plane usage, vegetarianism, freeganism, increased bicycle use, and a move towards composting. As discussed in previous lectures, these changes in transportation and diet greatly influence the amount of carbon emissions one releases into our atmosphere. While Kalmus discussed the many benefits these changes can have, such as his personal carbon emissions being cut back by over half, he does not neglect to mention that personal action is not the only way we will be able to satisfy the needs of the planet. 
   <br><br>


Kalmus also had a lot to say about collective action. His writing takes a heavy emphasis on the need for carbon taxing in order to decrease our reliance and usage of fossil fuels. Kalmus argued that by placing these taxes on carbon, people would be less inclined to emit carbon or participate in fossil fuel usage because the price would be too high for the standard of living we currently desire. I agree that this would be the best method to approach pushing out the fossil fuel industry. People will not want to pay more for something when there are adequate alternatives at their disposal. This will hopefully change the mindset of consumers and force a change to be made.



</p><hr>


<p>

While I am amazed by Peter Kalmus' personal changes he made in his life, I am more drawn to his chapter on collective action.  This is because I am pessimistic about the will of the average American to change their daily habits that will improve our carbon emissions.  The requirements for me to get under 2 metric tons of carbon dioxide is nearly impossible and I know I would not be able to do that.  And this is coming from someone who has a relatively small carbon footprint, I couldn't imagine what the average American would say if you asked them to stop flying, eating meat, driving, and more.  

   <br><br>

This is why I like focusing on public policy and making realistic changes that will greatly reduce our carbon footprint.  While people will say that we can't have gradual change and we must take action right now: you are probably right. However this is not going to happen so we must take actions that will improve our environment and be willing to compromise.  I think one great example of this is seen in the Carbon fees work section of the Collective Action chapter.  Kalmus says that it might be better to reinvest the taxes received from the carbon tax into improving the environment, however if they wanted the policy to succeed they had to reinvest the money into the people.  This worked in British Columbia and posed no detriment to the economic growth. This allows for bipartisan support through Congress, which is necessary when Republicans hold the Senate. This will also pose little economic detriment to the voters, who if hurt by climate change policy, would vote for representatives who would destroy our environment.

Not unexpectedly, "Being the Change" parallels the documentary and thus a lot of the information I was learning--at least the generalized concepts--weren't inherently new to me. While taking notes on these chapters, however, I noticed the overwhelming amount of numbers I was writing down, and just how absolutely jarring it was. I must say, upon watching the documentary, my greatest contingency was how Kalmus just kind of plowed through the topics. I didn't really get that much of an analysis into his actions, and that irritated me. The reading entirely redeems itself, however. I mean, I always knew the numbers for global warming were big, else we wouldn't be talking about it at the lengths we do, but after every sentence of the reading having to jot down a number in the thousands really gets you thinking about how scalar this problem is and just how the simplest of reductions, like getting a clothesline, create such massive changes.
    <br><br>

I think one of the more shocking aspects of his writing was the mention that if he was to change to electric and solar appliances, the balance would come out to approximately $18,000. Everyone and their mothers (metaphorically, as some of our mothers are Uncle Petes) that we should be switching to solar and electric when clearly that's not a viable option. Peter Kalmus shows us that it doesn't necessarily need to be a point of contingency, that he's made a living reducing his emissions without the underlying carbon costs of new technology. These options are reasonable for pretty much every background, and I say this knowing the fact that there are other nations who are significantly less draining than our energy consumption and still make life worth living.
    <br><br>

I found particular interest in the chapter "Collective Action". Kalmus really hits on the issue of bipartisanship and how divided we are, making politics out of everything when there's nothing to be seen. He mentions how many Republicans think that a free market is what they need, as less government regulation is better, but I think that's just shadowed by the biases of their party on the news. Kalmus believes they would actually be on the side of carbon fees should they just put their differences on the side, which seems so logical. Who doesn't want clean air! I agree with the need to fix the billionaire existences that don't even make rational sense, though I'm going to skip those arguments as I've seen them before, not that they aren't important, but Kalmus mentions a "Half-Earth" which is an ideal I can say I've genuinely never heard of before. Giving part of the world purely for the non-humans? Truly fascinating. He mentions international union, which seems well and good, but I do believe some of Peter's suggestions are a big far fetched, we are planet Earth after all, and even if it's on fire, the earthlings are willing to hit the big red button for extinction just to remain right.

I found it really interesting that in Chapter 9 of “Be the Change”, Peter talked about how he finds it depressing if reducing his global emissions is his main motivation because it'd be “like trying to save the world all by myself”. He then lists his own reasons as to why it brings him joy and motivation, like the connection to land, morals, and culture. I’ve never realized that that’s very similar to why I do these things too. I love that the connection I have to the planet and the way helping protect it makes me feel on the inside. I also found it very interesting that he enjoys the “shifting the culture” aspect of it as he shares his lifestyle and ideas with others. I think that it's such a great way to keep everyone around you informed and understand fully the choice you've made and something to think about doing if they'd like.
   <br><br>


I also enjoyed that he included a recipe for calculating your daily actions to emissions. I found out that I could easily reduce my emissions by various kg's if I were to just switch up my lifestyle a little bit, like go vegetarian, reduce my waste, or reduce my shopping for things I don’t need. These are easy things to do and I hope to continue to do them in order to not only make the environment feel better but so that I can feel better as well.

Elizabeth, I also found it empowering how Peter acknowledges the positive aspects of changing your lifestyle in order to reduce personal carbon emissions. In line with your mention of Peter's increasing connection to land, morals, and culture, I enjoyed this quote from chapter 9 that summarizes this mentality: "...by moving away from fossil fuel, I’m aligning my actions with my principles. Burning fossil fuel with the knowledge of the harm it causes creates cognitive dissonance, which can lead to feelings of guilt, panic, or depression. " I think that although it may be depressing to attempt to fix the planet on an individual basis, it is also detrimental to your mental health to continue harming the Earth while holding knowledge of your harm. We will be better off contributing our part, both collectively as a environmental influence, as well as individually to boost our happiness.

   <br><br>

Additionally, I appreciated how the author informed that everyone's emission profile will be unique and require different lifestyle adjustments. This decreases the pressure that we must all jump into unattainable radical actions.

I would say my favorite part of the reading was Kalmus' little algorithm/formula for estimating your annual greenhouse gas emissions. This is because I would venture to say a lot of the people who are aware they are emitting immense amount of greenhouse gases would probably not want to know the true destruction they are causing to the planet (some might). The first word that popped into my head when I saw this was accountability. Kalmus gives a clear cut way of estimating emissions in terms of planes, driving, trains/buses, natural gas, food, electricity, waste, and new stuff. This way people can estimate not only how much they are emitting, but WHERE they are emitting it from, and what part of their lifestyle they need to take a closer look at. Not trying to sound corny (maybe that's corny too but I don't care I'll say it anyway)- I really can't express enough how much value I think this course has. This has been the only class I have taken that I feel actively engaged in, so much so that I am consciously brought back to it every time I eat a meal (been trying out the vegan thing and I feel great), and every time I drive my car (mostly just making me feel bad for burning fossil fuels). Anyways, now that it is coming to an end, I felt a a public acknowledgement of my personal appreciation for the content and community of "ENG23" was necessary.

I agree with you. I also like the algorithm for calculating greenhouse gas emissions provided by the author. For scholars and student readers, the calculation formula is rigorous enough to increase persuasion, which makes it easier for intellectuals to accept the problem of global warming and change their behavior to protect the vulnerable environment. For ordinary people, the seemingly complex formula enables them to intuitively feel the damage of excessive carbon emissions to the environment, and control their own behaviors to attenuate the climate crisis.

Peter Kalmus’s use of a clothesline interested me the most because while I was studying abroad in France just this past Fall, my cohousing house did not have a dryer. I found this very frustrating because coming from America, having a dryer is a given, and we are used to having our clothes dried within less than an hour. It became even more frustrating during the winter when it would take an entire day or more for things such as my jeans and heavy sweaters to dry. I was so relieved to have a dryer when I returned back to the States, never even stopping to think WHY dryers were not a given in France. (During my time in France, I learned this is a cultural thing as many homes in France do not have dryers. And now I’m thinking about it, Japan too, it is a common practice to hang dry your clothes rather than use a dryer.) I never even stopped to think how home appliances affected my carbon footprint. Even though it was frustrating in the moment, I’m glad to know now that the lack of dryer actually reduced my carbon footprint while I was abroad. Now that I think about it, my aunt’s family recently asked my family for our old clothes drying pole to use at their house; maybe I can get my family to bring back the practice of naturally drying our clothes, too. 
   <br><br>

To be completely honest, much of Kalmus’s information in his chapter “Collective Action” went over my head, but I can appreciate his attention to detail and passion to back up his opinions with accurate facts. One important overarching message that resonated with me is the “lack of quantification” of different environmental actions and the lack of discussion and communication about their “relative effectiveness” (Chapter “Leaving Fossil Fuel”). Climate activism is a complicated issue because it is not enough for people to believe in the climate changing due to human actions and “do what they can” to help with the issue (i.e. change to eco-friendly light bulbs, drive EVs, change to a plant-based diet). Before this class, that’s where I was. I didn’t know different actions weighed more than others, and even if I did, I didn’t know which actions were better. I knew that a plant-based diet was better for the environment, but I didn’t know the extent of our Food Waste issue that arguably goes hand-in-hand with our problem with food. No one ever challenged me that flying was maybe my biggest carbon-footprint contributor and to challenge me to cut flying out. Kalmus, and Ken, have made me aware that quantifying the carbon-footprint of our individual actions is so important for us to make the most effective changes.

Peter Kalmus’ “Leaving Fossil Fuel” is one of the most comprehensible articles  I have read on CO2 reduction. The way he documents his approach to personal reduction is both relatable and awe-inspiring because they are steps that are not the most convenient or easily sustainable, but the reasonings he backs them up with shows how worthwhile and necessary these steps end up being. He describes how the moral, environmental, and personal implications of adhering to an environmentally detrimental lifestyle far out-weigh the inconveniences of personal CO2 emission reduction. I like how he focuses on personal action bred from personal reasons rather than the more common global panic reasons. While the global reasons are more important on a grand scale, I feel like coming up with personally fulfilling reasons to reduce our emissions will spark more action. He mentions cognitive dissonance, something I feel many of us experience despite what we may think, and I agree that taking steps to align our morals with our actions will produce happier, more fulfilling lives. Many reject any substantial lifestyle changes in support of CO2 reductions because it’s too much work, their way of life won’t permit it, or they think it won’t make that much of a difference. However, most people are completely unaware of the personal fulfillment it could bring and how lacking their lives are by being so fossil fuel dependent. 

   <br><br>

In “Collective Action,” Kalmus makes some very rational and valid points about a carbon fee being our best option, however, I think it will serve to create many problems elsewhere. First off, it is extremely unlikely that Congress will pass legislation that returns carbon fee proceeds back to the taxpayer and even if that happens it will nonetheless severely impact the lower and middle working class since they are the ones that usually must commute using fossil fuels or they will be out of a job. The wealthy sector of the U.S., the ones that emit the majority of fossil fuels,  most likely won’t be severely affected by a carbon fee since they will be able to pay it without drastically altering their lifestyles. If we’re acting on morals, how do we justify a solution that creates other problems? I know it doesn’t really matter how we lower emissions, it just needs to happen, but I am hopeful for a solution that lies in personal reform. By aligning our morals with our actions and creating an environmentally conscious life, people will experience greater fulfillment and will be more likely to pass their way of life onto their kids and so on. There are many reasons to reduce emissions, but the bottom line is the world is dying and taking care of the environment simply makes you a better person.

Hey Liani, I wanted to start off by saying that this first chapter of reading by Peter was a very comprehensible article on CO2 reduction. I agree with your statement that his approach to personal reduction is relatable, and definitely inspiring. He really proves to the rest of the world that if the average middle-class, American family can manage such a sustainable lifestyle while also being happier than ever before, why can’t the rest of us do the same? What I admire most about Peter is that not only does “...he [focus] on personal action bred from personal reasons”, as you said, but also the fact that he’s doing so out of shear selflessness. In the section of air travel, he said, “I decided I couldn’t justify putting my career over the biosphere”, which I found very kind and inspiring. I love how he addresses the issues in a way that we can understand, because he mentions how he had certain issues with things and then gave the solutions as to how he managed to resolve the issue. I enjoy this a lot, because he’s basically giving us a step-by-step manual on how to personally reduce our carbon emissions for the sake of our planet and well-being. He’s not just giving the facts to scare us, but giving us the solutions to reassure us.

After reading the article of being the change, I was impressed by Peter. The thing that impress me the most is that, in the first article, Peter said that the main reason why he is doing all these things to reduce carbon personal emission is that he really enjoys it. He enjoys that kind of lifestyle. This point really surprised me. In my mind, the reason why a person do all the things like flying less or eat a plant based diet is to protect the environment and save the climate crisis, but for him, he really like that kind of lifestyle. This make me start to think that if life such a lifestyle really happy. I think we need to have a try to experience it. Just as what the film happy said, the personal happiness does not depend on money or carbon emission. I think this article make me feel that live such lifestyle might be practical and enjoyable

In fact, I've been thinking about whether it's really worth doing to reduce carbon emissions and protect the environment from small things around us. First of all, it is undeniable that it is meaningful to do so, because no matter how valuable it is, we must protect the environment from ourselves, but I have always doubted how much we can contribute. For example, we eat less beef and travel less by plane to protect the carbon emissions of so many people around the world In fact, it is almost negligible. But the impact on our lives of eating less beef and choosing different means of transportation can be seen. So I've been struggling, not to mention how many people are infected even if we do it ourselves. However, this week's reading has given me new ideas. I fully agree that if we give up or use fewer cars and planes to travel and instead hike or ride bicycles, we will have more communication with people in the community, and more people may be willing to pay attention to and understand what we are doing, so that more people are more likely to be encouraged to reduce carbon emissions. Then the survey data and methods given in the article are really simple and effective, so I think this week's materials are really meaningful.

The testimonial style of exhibiting different lifestyle changes to adapt to the climate crisis in “Being the Change” was very effective in showing the ease with which one could live more sustainably. Not only does Peter Calms accept his ‘intertwined-ness’ with the systems that directly contribute to the climate crisis, but he’s able to show us how to live well for the planet within that.

   <br><br>

Through dismantling different approaches the government and various corporations have taken to lessen their carbon footprints he is able to expose the fallacy that is many of these ‘targeted’ solutions and goes on to propose real good solutions. The Cap-and-Trade limit on carbon usage, for example, is shown to have more benefits than drawbacks in chapter 14 and is communicated clearly to readers. I think Kalmus’ approach to addressing the climate change is a great idea for many folks to learn about, as it is expressed as a collection of simple changes that have dramatic impact, and has the potential to actually directly change people’s behavior.

The chapters assigned from Peter Kalmus’ Being the Change were just as inspiring as the documentary with the same title. He writes with simplicity but vast knowledge, making his book very palatable and accessible for anyone reading it, making his audience not just people educated on the topics, but anyone interested in reading more about this climate crisis. In the chapter “Leaving Fossil Fuel,” Kalmus explains why he personally has reduced his fossil fuel use, explaining that his life is better with less fossil fuel, he wants to better align his actions with his principles, and that he believes individual change can shift a culture. I agree with all three of these reasons, first because I believe that we could have many more connections and human interactions if we depended on the fossil fuel industry less, especially in terms of transportation and the way we get our food. The second argument he made really left an impact on me since I had never thought about it before: if we are worried about what is happening to our Earth and we do not make conscious decisions to help lessen the destruction, then we can become overwhelmed and distressed for not doing “our part.” Lastly, Peter Kalmus thinks that by making many small changes over time, he can encourage others around him to do the same and see the benefit in living a more environmentally conscious lifestyle. Realistically, I think there will need to be individual changes made by most people on our planet, in terms of being less wasteful and more resourceful. There are so many things we can do that will not affect our overall well-being, but more so just adjusting certain aspects of our lives. We know that activism has to be a part, but we do need to acknowledge that so does individual action.

The two chapters read in “Being the Change” by Peter Kalmus were definitely well written and much easier to comprehend than the film based on the book. I personally prefer the reading as it strictly pertained to the topic of discussions which is individually reducing greenhouse gas emissions and less about meditation that threw me off a bit. Anyways, I enjoyed the reading as it was a helpful and impactful guide of how to fight the climate crisis one person at a time beginning with yourself. I must say that although I did appreciate the reading and the usefulness of it, I was not necessarily eye opened considering that I have previously heard most of this information already. Although it was not new material to me it does not make it any less important to those who have not yet been exposed to his writings. Peter makes solid points about lifestyle change beginning with his own individual happiness. This can definitely be useful for someone who is currently trying to find the missing piece to their true happiness or whatever the case may be. Chapter 9 of “Being the Change” was nice as it provided two useful charts that I wish everyone was able to see. The first being about how to calculate your own greenhouse gas emissions. The second was normal, everyday activities greenhouse gas emissions so you can track your own footprint. Peter is clearly an intelligent man that should be getting more recognition for his accomplishments as a climate activist as well as his own personal life changes that set an excellent example of how more people should be living. Although I want to strive to get to a place Peter is at regarding lifestyle, it is hard for me to fully commit to everything he does. I do however attempt to try my absolute best by not flying, only biking, and eating primarily plant-based diets. Peter Kalmus is a true inspiration to me and I truly hope he continues to grow and be an inspiration to many more.

I agree, I feel like this reading was very straight to the point and reader-friendly. I can tell that Peter Kalmus is very passionate about the climate crisis and about spreading useful knowledge about it with the public. I found both his reading and his film incredibly helpful and inspiring. I found it interesting that we were assigned this reading along with the film because they obviously both have the same focus and ideas. However, I actually thought that it was helpful to be exposed to this information more than once so that I won't just forget about it afterwards. I like that Kalmus explains how we can keep track of our own CO2 emissions/carbon footprint, because I feel like it has already made me more conscious of all of my actions. I completely agree that Peter is incredibly inspiring to me and I truly admire everything that he is doing to fight the climate crisis.

I was much more moved by Kalmus's book "Being the Change" than the film. His writing is not only easy to read and comprehend, but Kalmus continuously backs up each of his proposals with a plethora evidence. In the first chapter read, Leaving Fossil Fuels, I loved how Kalmus showed us the breakdown of emissions, and even provided us with the tools to calculate our own. He essentially built an argument and then provided us with the means to test it out ourselves. He even acknowledges which actions were ones that perhaps not everyone would be able to take, and alternative actions you could turn towards instead. The snippet on "Climate Impact on Everyday Actions" was very intriguing to me. It was powerful to see the CO2 emission amounts of every day household actions and items. Overall this chapter was incredibly informative, and I even found myself learning new things in regards to emissions, which I didn't think was possible this far into the course! 
   <br><br>

The next chapter we read was no less powerful. I found this chapter even more impactful for myself personally. Prior to reading this chapter, I wasn't too incredibly informed on the concept of a carbon tax. I knew the fundamentals, but not much beyond that. This chapter not only does a fantastic job explaining why implementing a carbon tax would be beneficial, but also a great job shutting down other "less alarmist" tactics to emit fewer green house gases. I had not realized all the drawbacks of Cap-and-trade, and Kalmus's detailed and factual writing got straight to the point about why it simply would not work. He follows this up with an in depth explanation as to why a carbon tax would. Each of the beneficial aspects of the carbon tax he mentions (Predictable and stable, Bipartisan support, economic benefits, etc) are followed up with substantial evidence as to WHY and HOW it would work, which is incredibly key in proposing a climate oriented policy such as a carbon tax. People reading about a carbon tax need to be able to visualize how it would work in our economy in order to develop their own opinion on it. Along with this, he made it very clear that this was not thinly step to be taken. I liked how he included the battle in the court, to provide some perspective of the blockages we face in regards to bringing about policies such as the carbon tax to the government. 
   <br><br>

Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this reading, and was happy to have it as our final one.

I too found this reading to be even more impactful than the film"Being The Change" as Kalmus was able to not only outline countless ways in which one can reduce their personal emissions, but also approached climate change from an economic and therefore broader scale as well. I also found myself learning many new facts regarding emissions such as the fact that six of the nation's largest oil companies are calling for the world to adopt carbon fees! Who would've thought? Along with this, I found it extremely interesting that Peter mentioned that although he was able to decrease his emissions by a factor of 10, he still emits twice the amount of CO2 as the average Bangladeshi. I think that this staggering fact only emphasizes the idea that the United States must act now before we expect any developing countries to create significant change regarding emissions. Furthermore, as Ken has mentioned in the past it really isn't even a matter of helping developing countries such as Bangladesh reduce their emissions, but rather aiding in the expansion of their own economies and standard of living while the U.S. and other developed nations significantly reduce their own carbon footprints. 
   <br><br>
I also agree with your statement that Kalmus is very effective in shutting down "less alarmist" tactics while emphasizing the necessity of a carbon tax. With all of the evidence presented by Kalmus as to how and why a carbon tax would work, it's a mystery as to why there isn't greater support for an idea that would help the U.S. and the rest of the world make serious progress towards shifting over to sustainable energy sources.

I really enjoyed these two book chapters and I plan to read the rest of the book during Spring Break (I'm really glad that Ken picks readings that are easily accessible for free so that I can continue my study without costing money). It was really interesting to see the perspective of a climate scientist who is actually enacting what they're saying. It's really annoying to see climate activists who aren't living eco-friendly lives themselves even if they are perfectly capable of doing so. Some time ago, I watched a TEDTalk of a really famous zero-waste advocate. She mentioned that one of the many benefits of living a zero-waste lifestyle was saving money. She then proceeded to tell the audience that she uses the saved money to take trips with her family. Devastatingly, she flies to places as far as Australia (her home is in California) for each of these trips. Although getting rid of much of her stuff is really beneficial to the environment, I imagine that she's adding more GHG to the atmosphere from flying than she removed from getting rid of stuff. The most depressing thing about this was that she made these comments on a TEDTalk that was widely shared. People who don't know about the detrimental environmental effects of flying (like me before I took this class even though I considered myself fairly educated about climate change before taking the class) will think that it is a good thing for the environment to replace their stuff with lavish vacations that require ridiculous levels of flying. I don't think that the person who presented the TEDTalk meant any environmental harm by telling people about the vacations she's able to take with the money she saved from being living a zero-waste lifestyle. She presents herself as an environmentalist and also shares her journey with compost--and I believe she's doing so genuinely. I just think that she is uneducated about the negative effects of flying, so she doesn't realize what she's doing and telling people. That's why I really liked that Kalmus is a climate scientists as well as an environmental activist. He's able to make eco-friendly decisions in ways that he objectively knows are effective. He also provides easy calculations for his readers to do the same, which ensures that his environmental activism is actually effective.

I found the scientific approach Kalmus used to convey the what compelled him to action more appealing. While it is important to address the problem with others by connecting on a basis of beliefs rather than facts, I felt this way satisfied both. As a scientist, Kalmus recognized his own individual actions in conflict with his morals and decided to do something about it. Not only did he succeed in reducing his negative impact, but he claims to have become happier.
   <br><br>

Upon realizing his impact in numerical form, Kalmus was able to develop creative solutions, became more physically involved in his daily activities, and strengthened the bond within his community. All the while, he was able to learn new things and was open to change. I think where many people fall short is the first crucial step of introspection; we seldom want to admit that we are contributing to the problem. However, Kalmus makes his contribution irrefutably clear by calculating his own emissions and decidedly changing his life.
   <br><br>

My favorite part of chapter 9 was the quote, “If you choose flying, go forth and fly. But please don’t pretend your life is sustainable”. We have extensively discussed the impacts of flying in class, though this resonated with me as I have made many drastic changes to my own lifestyle by the same principle. I became a vegetarian and now a vegan with the mindset that I couldn’t be an environmentalist if I personally did not make these changes. This is such a big thing that must be addressed in my life as I, like Kalmus, generate the vast majority of my emissions from air travel, though it is proving to be far more difficult for me than eliminating animal products from my diet. I am optimistic though; as veganism has inspired me to learn how to cook and challenged me to use my more limited selection of food wisely and creatively, I’m sure I will discover other positive externalities of eliminating planes from my life too.
   <br><br>

In last week’s reading “Bending the Curve”, I learned how communicating information as upfront facts can be off-putting, come off as alarmist, or otherwise deter people rather than inspire and mobilize. I did not find Kalmus’s work to be any of these, which is astonishing considering how fraught with data it was. I believe it is due to his integration of personal change; after nearly each section of quantitative assessment, he addressed how his own life was changed qualitatively. I feel that this helps bridge the gap between culture and science, as the two must work together to ultimately battle the climate crisis.

The chapter “Leaving Fossil Fuels” was very insightful as it cleared the misconception that many have when faced with the pressure to make lifestyle changes in order to help the planet. Many people believe that their actions on a personal level will not make any impact whatsoever on a global scale, however Kalmus brings up the point of “shifting culture” through one’s actions. As we are all part of a community that connects us to a greater society worldwide, one change in our lifestyle can trickle down into the lives of others and cause a shift in the way we perceive the norm. Thus, every action, whether big or small, can have larger effects on the world around us, so we should never feel discouraged that we cannot make a change. I like how Kalmus comes forth with his main uses of carbon emissions and confronts them head on, and acknowledges that a large part of it comes from air travel in itself, unlike the average person, so the readers are not expected to cut down their emissions by such a large percentage, which can feel overwhelming. He tackles the main points that we have gone over in class such as waste, food, transportation, and so on to reinforce the importance of the way we confront our needs. This chapter was very informative and strengthened his credibility largely because he was transparent in acknowledging his carbon footprint and how he lowered it before telling the readers to do the same.

I completely agree with you that it was critical for Kalmus to include how our individual actions can impact others and eventually create a culture change. Last summer, I decided that I wanted to be vegetarian and start composting. I didn't expect my family to do the same since they didn't seem very interested in doing what I was doing themselves. Even though I started composting our entire family's kitchen scraps, it was made very clear to me that the compost bin would be my responsibility and my responsibility alone. This only lasted for a couple weeks until my family gave in and started to join me (and I did no convincing, they just liked what they observed me doing). My mom was already vegetarian (and has been for nearly 30 years for health reasons), but my dad and brother were meat-eaters. My brother still loves eating meat, but my dad has probably reduced his meat consumption by 50% since I became vegetarian. He realized that it wouldn't be cost-effective to only buy meat for 2 people rather than 3 (this is because we shop at Costco and only 2 people eating meat isn't enough to finish Costco's serving sizes, so he stopped buying meat so food wouldn't go to waste). He also realized that I enjoyed being vegetarian, which encouraged him to lower his meat consumption. He has even started bragging to the cashiers when he's buying groceries that he's started to eat less meat for the environment even though he's a Boomer. But the most drastic improvement was with the compost bin. My dad now loves the compost bin, and he even wants to buy another one so we have enough space to compost our garden clippings as well as our food waste. He's just like those memes of the dads who are in love with a dog that 2 weeks ago, they said they didn't want and wouldn't take care of, but with the compost bin instead. He even goes to check on the compost several times a week and update me on its progress since I live on campus.

Hi, I completely agree with your comment on how the reading was very descriptive and informational. It seems to me that the theme of the chapters and his message to us readers were that you could reduce your carbon emissions and still have fun in life. I think that many people are afraid about change and to make the switch to a fossil fuel-less lifestyle  as it might be filled with struggle and conflict. I think the author does a good job on providing the readers with solid information and enthusiasm towards the ongoing problem of global warming. I also liked how Kalmus explains that small actions do matter and can lead to bigger things. This behavior can lead to greater things and possibly inspire others to follow the change.

My favorite environmental changes presented in Kalmus's book chapters were those surrounding composting, eating locally/seasonally, and growing your own food. This is because I see it as most fun for me and most realistic to do in my lifestyle. (I also appreciate how Kalmus advocated doing things that are realistic for us before moving on to other things since I think that making changes that make us happy mean that we are more likely to continue with these changes, which is ultimately what is needed to address the climate crisis.) I am a green thumb and my dad and I bond over our garden in our backyard. Our local nursery (for plants, not kids) is one of my favorite places to go and I get excited every year to plant our summer vegetable garden. I also love being out in my backyard during the summer because I get to lounge under a big tree and look at my rose bushes. While we don't grow enough food for all the produce my family of 4 eats in the summer (especially considering that my 20 year old brother is 6 ft and exercises multiple hours a day and that my dad is 6'3"), but we are still able to grow a substantial amount of food. I've always loved this food since it tastes dramatically better, but I became really proud of what I was growing with my dad when this class taught me how eco-friendly it is to eat locally and seasonally--and there's no better way to eat locally and seasonally than growing your own food! I also started my family's first compost bin last summer. This summer is the first time the compost will be ready to use in the garden, so I'm looking forward to seeing how much more productive our plants will be since they have compost as a fertilizer for the first time. In this way, being eco-friendly by composting also helps us become even more eco-friendly by increasing the amount of food we are able to grow, which is something I find extremely cool. I've noticed that performing one eco-friendly activity makes other eco-friendly activities easier and more productive to do, which is something I think should be talked about more since it is very encouraging.

I found this reading very interesting when he broke down all of his emissions and the amount of CO2 that is saved by these emissions. I felt as if this reading brought back a hope that many people had lost thinking individual actions cannot make a change. I thought it was crazy he was able to reduce his emissions factor by 10. Also I really liked the part where he stated his three incentives, his first, it is enjoyable using less and riding a bike more, his second: you no longer have to feel guilt for using fossil fuels. And finally third: he believes his reduction helps, especially with changing culture. He then went on to state his five most effective actions were quitting planes, vegetarianism, bicycling, freeganism, and composting. Although I do not fly very often I think my top reductions would include the same just in a different order. I also think another important fact he stated is knowing where our products come from. Although we may choose a plant based diet he said over two thirds of food waste happens before the checkout line. This also relates to what Ken mentioned about asparagus in the winter. In order to make a change you need to eat with the environment in mind and source foods more locally or even in your backyard. 
   <br><br>

I also thought his ideas in the second chapter regarding global warming is a market failure were very interesting. I had never thought of it in this way. An interesting factor he brings up regarding a way to solve this is. He says that nations in which we import stuff may not be environmentally sustainable in their production and we cannot force them to be. But instead he said we could implement a widget across the US which would charge the dirty countries a tariff. He mentions this would be an incentive for them to change their ways of production.

I agree with you Layne this week’s reading of the two chapters of “Being the Change” by Peter Kalmus was very interesting in the way he broke everything down. The chapters “Leaving Fossil Fuels” and “Collective Action” were enlightening. I loved the guide he included for the reads that allowed them to calculate their own greenhouse gas emissions. His inclusion of charts and graphs that showed the impact of our everyday actions to the climate. This chapter really explains in great detail and in an easy to read way that allows everyone to easily understand. The approaches he offers to solve climate change are also very interesting because he offers “old” and “new” options. Kalmus explains how changing simple things in our lives like reducing our food waste, switching to plant based diets, flying less, biking more, and so much more will reduce our fossil fuel emissions as well as possibly increase our happiness. By getting rid of unnecessary materialist objects from our lives we are increasing our happiness by getting rid of distractions. These useless objects are keeping us down in the dumps because we are constantly wanting the best and newest things. We will increase our happiness by giving back to the planet and trying to contribute to the community instead of just taking from it. I also never thought of global warming as a market failure. I agree it’s interesting how he says how nations import stuff that are not environmentally sustainable, and we cannot force them to be. 
   <br><br>

Professor Hiltner mentions how personal Kalmus takes this issue which I agree is very cool because we have not seen this issue handled in this way. Kalmus talks about his garden, growing his own foods and all the other things he has done to reduce his waste. Not only did he talk about the issues we face today, but he provided solutions to these issues as well as things we as your average citizen can be involved in this change. Overall I enjoyed this week’s reading and I also enjoyed how Professor Hiltner expanded on these ideas.

Peter Kalmus' book, 'Being the Change', was different from the film in a number of ways. Mainly, it focused less on the emotional/spiritual aspects of climate activism and action and turned instead to the cold hard facts. I feel in this way the book and the film together can reach a very wide audience, since these approaches appeal to different people. 
   <br><br>


The most intriguing part I found about the 'Being the Change' book was the section on implementing a carbon fee/dividend. I can easily see the concept gaining bipartisan support and being implemented at least in some US states, if not on a federal level eventually depending on how 2020 turns out for the Senate. It would punish those who use fossil fuels most and really, truly empower those at the bottom with the dividend (as opposed to the current tax brackets alone). As the agricultural impacts of climate change begin to come to fruition, some conservative states might change their stances on the issue and implement a carbon fee. 

   <br><br>

What really stuck out to me personally as a physics major here, is that Peter Kalmus works at JPL and while most would consider him a 'hippie', he proves that he actually knows what he's talking about. I completely agree with his points about the state's responsibility for climate protection, redistribution of extreme wealth gaps, and getting money out of politics (and I would add, the filibuster). Most of all, though, was the fact that we as a nation can't even agree on basic facts. 'Perhaps democracy has been sickened by Facebook and Twitter. I have a new appreciation for its fragility.' Indeed, social media has been shown to be not only the main source of 'news' for the politically apathetic, but it allows the politically invigorated to exist in their own echo chamber, as online circles begin to foster increasingly extremist attitudes. While I do believe political extremism has its place, I think it must act on a common set of facts (see: Trump's 'alternative facts'). The above issues of broken political systems and social media have all created this world of 'alternative facts' where bipartisanship becomes impossible. I will say, however, I have personally seen far more progress from the left on fixing things like gerrymandering, the filibuster, money in politics, and of course wealth inequality. Many (but maybe not all) of those things should be sought by both sides, but moneyed interests say otherwise.

In the reading “Leaving Fossil Fuel” and “Collective Action”, I have taught some ways to both individually and collectively address climate change. Even before reading the article, I realized that car use definitely plays a major rule in one’s carbon emission. And that is why I asked my parents to reconsider the decision to buy another vehicle, even an electric one. Because of the long commuting time my parents have on their way to work places every morning, they have decided to buy another car. As in China, buying electric car can get a subsidy. They told me that they would purchase an electric one. However, I said no as soon as they told me the decision, as well as the reason-the cost on carbon emission. As first, they did not think that it is a big deal. After watching the video I recommended to them, they have realized the importance of not buying another car.

This reading was really informative about the climate crisis. It is interesting how in the "leaving fossil fuel" chapter Kalmus was honest about what he was doing wrong. To truly make a change in our lives we have to self reflect and realize what our own practices have a negative impact on the environment. I think if we all tried to live lives that are sustainable and reduces our carbon footprint we could all get more joy and be happier everyday. It is important to realize how all of our choices impact the environment and are hurting the environment and as being people who live in an advanced country and because the climate crisis is mostly our fault, we have to adjust our own lives to make the world a better place.

After reading the chapter “Leaving Fossil Fuel '' in Peter Kalmus’s book Being the Change I wasn’t shocked to hear that his plane travel was the main thing reducing his carbon footprint. His promise to stop flying reduced his carbon footprint more than freeganism, hot water, vegetarianism, compost, home grown, biking, renewable electricity, etc. combined. This is a huge statistic because you can see a singular career change outweighs intense life changing habits with regards to cutting down Co2 production. I love how Peter mentions how many people tell him, “the plane is going to depart anyway” as an argument against reducing air travel.I also have heard that argument regarding vegetarianism, saying “someone is going to eat it, why don’t you?” but what Peter explains is that, if there is a cultural shift such as significant levels of less flying and meat consumption, the industries providing these services will have to eventually reduce their output. The change, however, relies on a cultural shift which won’t happen overnight. It can however start with brave individuals such as Peter Kalmus. Peter Kalmus’s chapter “Collective Action” shows how we can get action in the best way possible. I love how he laid out all of the benefits of carbon fees such as lowering emissions, providing economic benefits, bipartisan support, etc. We need more strong collective action in order to be the change that will save our planet!

"Being the Change" by Peter Kalmus changed my idea on how people's behavior can change our environment. In America, I can see most families have two cars, that's why American has the most cars in the world, and American has the highest Carbon footprint in this world. In this movie, the author showed us some behavior which can snowball the earth, it can have a positive effect on our earth. As Ken stated in this course, we can choose to ride bus and bike, it can drastically reduce the carbon emission to the earth. Ken suggested that we can ride bikes to San Francisco, i think that it is a very good idea. The purpose of traveling is not all about the destination, sometimes it’s the scenery along the way.

After reading chapter 9 of Being the Change, titled “Leaving Fossil Fuels,” I thought the most interesting bit was how Peter included a guide for readers to calculate their own greenhouse gas emissions as well as another chart detailing the climate impact of everyday actions, like doing laundry, showering, or even charging our portable devices. This is impactful because it allows ordinary citizens (such as myself) to really grasp the amount of damage that we are doing to our planet. In addition to this, I thought that this chapter was a great read because it describes, in great detail, Peter’s own recollection of how he has worked as an individual to lower his impact on the environment.

   <br><br>

I thought “Collective Action” of Being the Change was also pretty compelling because it included two approaches to solving the climate crisis: the old approach and a more refined approach. Not only did Peter include statistics as to how the modernized solution has proved to work (like in the “Carbon Fees Work” section of the chapter), but he also provided a vast amount of steps that we can take to mitigate the climate crisis. At the conclusion of the chapter, he notes, “When I feel unsure about whether or not I should speak out, I think of the billions of people with no voice on the matter. I think of those who are most vulnerable. I think of my children.” This stuck with me the most because it has been shown time and time again that the individuals who are most resistant to comprehending the climate crisis are boomers. This statement made me question whether or not older folks are thinking of younger generations-- or if they refuse to change their ways/opinions out of selfishness.

I also found the greenhouse gas emissions guide provided by Kalmus to be both interesting and useful. While we have been provided a lot of different info pertaining to how our actions can affect the climate situation in this class, until now we have not really been able to put numbers to it. I think that something like this can be real wakeup call to people; I am sure most did not realize that simply doing laundry can have a significant environmental impact. I believe tools like this are important steps in combatting climate change. The more people become aware of the impact of their everyday actions, the more people will realize the gravity of the issue and start taking measures to reform. The "Collective Action" part caught my eye as well. By not only providing different solutions to combat this issue but statistics to back them up as well, he does a really good job to persuade readers of the efficacy of these methods. While many people can dispute different opinions on solutions, when cold hard facts are presented in front of you, it is hard for most people to argue. Overall, I think Peter Kalmus is doing an incredible job in spreading awareness and working towards a change in this field, and I hope he continues to get the recognition he deserves.

<br><Hr>
I, too, found the greenhouse gas emission calculation an interesting and important part of this week’s reading. I think people should understand and be able to quantify their impact on today’s climate and hence the future’s climate. I agree that these calculations have impact and that everyone should become more self aware through their knowledge of how their daily life choices have an effect on the environment. Seeing your impact in numbers can help us put both our negative and positive contributions into perspective. “Collective Action” also stood out to me and I find the quote you mentioned to be one of the most important concepts that we should keep in mind in regards to the climate crisis and this course. When we think about the voice that we have and the opportunities we have to speak out, we must keep in mind that many people are not even given a chance to. We must take advantage of our circumstances by raising awareness, voting, and making our voices heard.

I feel like the reading for this week is a bit boring. I guess that it is because Kalmus quoted a lot of statistics, which makes me think that reading is a bit incoherent and disconnected. However, the overall organization of the information that we know about the solution to global warming is very inspiring, and there are also some details that touched me.
   <br><br>


When Kalmus mentioned that the pollution emission does not only include the amount that is brought by the food itself, but also the amount brought by producing the packaging and transportation of them. This piece of information made me recollect the shock bought to me by ken when he taught that the worst thing about the car is not its carbon emission exhausted, but the emission while producing a car. It just makes me feel that we always put out attention and focus on the bigger picture and, a lot of the time, ignored the small and easy-to-solve part of our lives. Yes, reducing carbon emission and the use of Fossil Fuels globally is hard to do. It requires individuals’, governments’, and countries’ supports, altogether. However, working on the smaller part is not so hard. The market can do it by simply using more paper bags than plastic ones or importing goods from a nearer location rather than using, such as air transportation, the worst thing, right? I know that this cannot be an enormous amount of contribution to solving environmental problems. However, I believe that the accumulation of every supermarket or individual adopts this lifestyle, will be at least become a small turning point.

   <br><br>

We are college students, and there are some suggestions that are somewhat impractical for us, but there must be something we could do, those small things. You can do it by bringing clothe bags to supermarkets or something as simple as that.



</p><hr>


<p>

I am once again astounded by the amount of time, effort, and research a single man has put into fighting climate change. Kalmus’ work is extremely thorough, straight to the point, and above all, inspiring to read and watch. I find it very informative how Kalmus covers nearly every aspect of life and has a suggestion for how to make that part of your life more environmentally sustainable.
   <br><br>


A lot of the suggestions he had were previously discussed in class—fly less (or don’t fly at all), change your diet, use less energy, vote and make your voice heard, educate people about pregnancies, create less waste, use public transportation instead of driving your own car, etc., etc. The list goes on. He also provides his own take on making these changes and proves to readers again and again how happy he is with his life despite having made so many changes.

I found the charts that compared his carbon emissions from 2012 to 2014 really interesting to look at, because it showed me that within two years time, I could be making that big of a difference (although it might be a little difficult while living in college). He even provides a “recipe” of how we could estimate our own emissions so that we could see the difference we’re personally making.

   <br><br>

I also found it promising that implementing a carbon fee would not hurt the economy that much. It is a common counterargument to the topic, but after reading Kalmus’ explanation, it is clear that it would not be as he calls it, an “economic drag.” Furthermore, I was not aware that six of the world’s largest oil and gas companies have pressed for the rest of the world to adopt carbon fees. The fact that even fossil fuel industries themselves are pushing for a worldwide carbon fee makes it even more credible and possible.

I am also amazed at the effort Kalmus has put into fighting climate change, not just for the world, but also just to make him happier as a person. Looking at his charts from 2012-2014 was very intriguing, because it made me realized that in just a small amount of time, I could make a huge difference, and yea it’s it more difficult in college. One thing that really interested me was when he said he using clothes pins to dry his clothes and frankly I use do that all the time back home, because one it’s more efficient and two using the dryer to much ruins my clothes and eventually starts to put holes and fade the color. I also really enjoyed looking at his “recipe”, because it made me want to calculate my own emissions, although I know for a fact, they would be high. Also, not going to lie at first the carbon tax wouldn’t work either figuring that fossil fuel companies would never go for it, but after reading two chapters of his book and founding out that some of the worlds largest oil companies are pushing for it does make it seem like it is more likely to happen.

Yes, I feel the same about how surprising it is that this one person, Peter, decided to make a change in his life. I find it even more inspiring that yes as a climate scientist he is fighting climate change, but he also did it because living a life without fossil fuels is better. I think I could see and agree with how he says this because you eat better and healthier foods, you ride your bike and feel the fresh air rather than suffocate in a car or train, and overall you just create a better relationship with the earth and your community.
   <br><br>

The fact that we have Peter Kalmus doing what he is doing, shows that is it possible. But I think that is what I'd focus on. It is possible for those who can do it. I know not every single person can do every single thing he did. I know not every parent can switch to organic foods etc. because it may be expensive. I know some people need their cars in order to transport something for work. Although everyone can't do everything, it is important to note that anyone can make any simple life change at any time.
   <br><br>

I think that was my greatest take away from Kalmus. He is a role model for anyone in different ways, whether it be completely, or only a few aspects of life. He showed us that someone can do. Hopefully people can follow in his steps.



<br><hr>
Enya made an amazing point when she emphasized how much time and effort Kalmus put into his own studies regarding his carbon footprint. From my own attempts to eat foods that are better for the environment, taking the train and other factors I have never even come close to the impact he has made on truly taking charge. This makes me think of an idea I had earlier in the course of creating an online system that can calculate and show each person’s carbon footprint in order from highest to lowest carbon emissions. Through the answering of a few questions, we could all hopefully have a data basis similar to the one that Kalmus created for himself. His commitment to not only creating sustainable choices in the future but to ensuring that he is working to the full capacity of his ability to make a change is incredibly inspiring. Like Enya expressed, his own happiness through the changes he has made is inspiring. I truly believe that he has a sense of peace knowing that he is doing his part. Knowing all that he does regarding the climate crisis is surely extremely overwhelming. Through what I have learned in this course alone I have experienced anxiety regarding the future and pressure to make drastic changes in my own life. I can't imagine being a climate scientist and knowing the full extent of the problem regarding climate change. I really understand his need for meditation. His happiness in his lifestyle changes is a great way to model to others that change, ranging from small to drastic changes, does not have to be a scary thing. Using the charts to compare the potential I have was extremely beneficial. In times where I struggle to keep my current climatarian diet or am tempted to drive home instead of taking the train, I believe that I will think back to Peter Kalmus and his portrayal of the large effect I could be having. Providing a so called “recipe” will make it so much easier for people who are not as passionate about altering their lives and educating themselves fully to still have an impact. This to me, is equally as important to have on the forefront of climate change education as well. A basic understanding is obviously needed, but not everyone can be a climate scientist and devote their lives which is why the recipe is genius.

I enjoyed this week’s reading much more than last week’s film. Though both included Peter Kalmus and his life, I felt like this week’s reading was much more concise and logical. I think the list format of the reading, similar to Project Drawdown, is a very effective way of communicating. Each individual change is thoroughly explained and carefully calculated. 
   <br><br>

Kalmus’ top five most effective actions, quitting planes, vegetarianism, bicycling, freeganism, and composting, were very interesting to me. Unlike Project Drawdown, Being the Change gives a much more personal approach to personal actions. Although Project Drawdown’s top five ways to limit greenhouse gas emissions is more accurate, I think that Kalmus’ list is much more valuable. It is much more convincing to read about personal changes from someone who has done it himself.
   <br><br>

Like you, I felt inspired after reading about Kalmus’ analysis of his emissions. It made me reflect on my own life and my own emissions. I also found the ending of the reading this week to be insightful. I think it is incredibly beneficial to be able to calculate our own emissions to be able to adjust our own living styles. This reading really comes to show that one person can make a major beneficial personal and global difference.

I find it really cool how someone wanting to better their life, also chose to do it by fighting climate change. I think a problem with why climate change isn't such a big thing is because people are afraid or don't wanna to make change to their daily lives. People don't realize that even the smallest change can have such an impact if enough people do it. I think that people see climate change  as this huge looming thing that can't  be stopped so they choose to do nothing instead of make positive changes like Kalmus did. Change doesn't have to be difficult, it can be as simple as just taking the bus to work instead of driving or limiting your energy consumption every day, which can have such a larger impact than doing nothing.

I think in regards to chapter 14 of the reading, I have the most apprehension to the idea of implementing a carbon tax in the U.S. in its current state. As is, theoretical alternatives such as bikes and public transportation are too unreliable to be practical alternatives. This is mostly due to oil company interests such as the Koch brothers fighting back against funding for projects that would implement better means for public transportation, such as high speed railways. This should be more immediately dealt with before implementing a carbon fee, so that the shift will be easier for the working-class people who have to rely on their cars to get to work. While it is suggested that everyone would get a check back from the revenue generated from such a fee, I am not very sure how likely it would be to work without any interference happening from parties that are fueled by their own self-interest. I do think we need to shift towards a society less reliant on fossil fuels, and that it needs to happen quickly, but I am unsure if a carbon fee is the best go-to option.

I found this week's reading, “Being the Change,” by Peter Kalmus to be quite interesting and informative. Kalmus expresses that we all want to achieve happiness, although continue to frantically consume items in bid for happiness, global warming is worsening. Peter Kalmus recognized this crisis and decided to embark on a journey himself to help change the world as well as the life of himself. He began to make simple changes such as growing food, biking, and Meditating  just to name a few. Throughout this process, he constantly emphasized that he was becoming increasingly happier as he went along and he ended up cutting his climate impact to under a tenth of the United States average. Kalmus also stresses the importance of personal action as well. They say that each one of us has the power to make the world better or worse and each of us can decide whether to act positively or pull back and be part of the crisis. Kalmus accepts the fact that he can not alone save the world so he instead tries to live a good life in which reflects that he believes he can change the world because “small actions lead to larger ones.”
   <br><br>

I particularly agree with Kalmus about the importance of personal action. I believe people need to stop worrying about the world and focus on themselves. I think the more personal action that we each take will encourage others around us to be interested in our lifestyles and hopefully be influenced to join in. If we are constantly worried about changing the world altogether at once or having a mindset that your personal change will have no effect, the climate crisis is going to continue to worsen.

Agreeably, I really enjoyed the approach Peter Kalmus takes on the climate crisis. He represents a great combination of scientific knowledge on climate change and everyday know-how on how to live more sustainably. Through the eyes of a scientist, Peter educates his readers on the realities of carbon emissions via the individual. Simultaneously, he guides the audience through his own life, revealing the everyday steps he takes to be more environmentally conscious. It’s the little things, like using a closeline rather than drying all your clothes, that really add ip in the long run of carbon emissions. His top five emission saving life style changes (no planes, vegetarianism, bicycling, freeganism, and composting) I found to be very interesting. Composting was the one I found to be most surprising on the list; it’s a relatively simple and well known process that people do not utilize enough. In our community, efforts of groups such as IV Compost are taking steps to show how achievable and beneficial composting is. Peter and the rest of the Kalmus family are living proof that sustainability can be our reality. I appreciate how they are leading by example, and though their lifestyle isn’t realistic for everyone, it’s a lifestyle that anyone can learn and take advice from.

I am one of those people who worry about the world instead of doing it myself. When I learned that we are going to be the sixth mass extinction, I was worried and scared. But did I do anything in my life to prevent this from happening? No I did not. What I am starting to realize by taking this class is to start doing little changes. I mean I cannot just all of a sudden quit using electricity or eating meat. But I have to do little things like stop throwing away left over food and making sure that I recycle. I feel one of the hardest ones I will have to face is flying. I would like to take train and boat but will I be able to be that committed. Also taking train and boat will be time consuming which can conflict with my job.  You have to start somewhere and I think that if I work on myself on small things for the environment, I will be able to do bigger deeds for the environment.
<br><Hr>
I really agree with the points you have made. Peter Kalmus gave up a lot when he learned that his carbon footprint was much larger than that of an average American. I commend him for realizing that, as a climate scientist, he had to put his words into action. He lowered his carbon footprint by no longer flying, trying to bike everywhere he had to go, eating a plant based diet, and aggressively composting. He explains that it was difficult and sometimes expensive to get some things replaced in his home in order for his home to be more environmentally friendly. This is not something a lot of Americans and others that are a part of the developing world, are willing to do. 
   <br><br>
	I know that I want to do what I can in order to lower my carbon footprint and play my part in helping the planet. I get worried that our future generations will suffer for the actions I make everyday. But do I constantly keep in mind the planet when I go about my day? The answer is no. I know I am hypocritical if I advocate doing what we can to help the planet, but I am not doing my part. I hope to take what Kalmus says into serious consideration and communicate what we can do personally and as a whole to save the planet. The chapters we read from Kalmus’ book are very informative and detailed that everyone can do something to lower their CO2 emissions.

I really liked this weeks reading, especially the chapter on collective action, because it dived deeper into the economic impacts that saving our planet will have.  Although I hear a lot about and support a green new deal, I still was somewhat unaware of the exact economic policies that would make something on that scale feasible.  Peter Kalmus did an excellent job of breaking down the different economic options we have presented to us if we hope to mitigate the climate crisis, and did an even better job defending his view of which one was best.  I frankly thought that the documentary on the book we watched last week did not do a very good job of inspiring me to take action on these issues, I viewed it as a niche lifestyle he was living and naive that he believed others would readily take it up.  Because of this I was expecting the book to do no better in educating me about our future necessary actions, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I was very interested in the economic options we have laid before us, and the key differences between them.  Even after going through weeks of climate change material I was still unaware of the difference between a carbon tax and a carbon fee, and what a monumental difference choosing one over the other would make.  Although I supported the green new deal, there was still some part of me that was really worried about the effects it would have on our economy.  I wasn't even worried for my own or others economic stability per say, rather I was concerned that if the economy suffered under an administration that was supporting radical climate activism, they would be voted out by the American people the very next election cycle.  Historically economic hardship has been a major factor in U.S. elections, and I can rest easier now that I have a clearer view of just how a carbon fee would actually help our economy.  Above that, it would help the most disadvantaged people in our society the most, leading to an all around better society.  It was presented in such a way that it even seemed beneficial in the long term for the very energy companies that are destroying our planet currently.  That is incredible, and if we can find a way to change our economic structure to incentivize both individual and corporate changes towards the environmentally friendly, our planet might just be saved.

I too was especially intrigued by this week's reading. I shared some of the feelings about last week's documentary also by Peter Kalmus and his lifestyle in regards it seeming niche. To me the documentary made the changes he made feel specific to Peter, making them seem difficult to replicate. The beauty in this, as the reading points out is that it can be specific and different for each of us. We don't have to follow Peter's lifestyle to reduce our emissions, we just have to recognize the largest contributors to our footprint and find ways to decrease or even eliminate their contributions. The reading gave us the formula to decreasing our emissions. 
   <br><br>

The portion on carbon fee and dividend was enlightening. Like you, I didn't know the difference between a carbon tax and a carbon fee with dividend. Peter went into depth about the latter, making a great case for how it would improve income inequality while incentivizing a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. This honestly gave me a lot of hope. This seems like an extremely viable option. This idea needs to be mainstreamed. I feel like the term "carbon tax" and even "carbon fee" to someone who doesn't know the difference has such a negative stigma. Before reading this all I thought about carbon taxes was an increase in the price of everything. I didn't think about the possibility of a dividend. All I knew was that prices for pretty much everything would be affected. Reaching the majority of the public, and reversing the stigma of a carbon fee and dividend could prove crucial to the health of our planet.

One thing I liked about”Being the Change,” that’s different from the other readings we had in the past, was the use of statistics in application to personal actions. For example, Peter Kalmus charted his carbon emissions before and after he cut out flight from his lifestyle, and presented it in the readings. Seeing a visual of his argument really drives home the point he makes about the importance of choosing more sustainable options in everyday life. I like how he emphasizes that every little action we do can amount to tremendous environmental impact. The key is to implement these changes and encourage others to do the same. He takes into account the inequality behind the climate crisis, noting that the US richest 20% are responsible for 32% of emissions while the poorest 20% only cover 9% of emissions. This ties in what we learned in previous weeks, that the richest 10% of the world are responsible for half of all emissions, yet we are the least affected by the consequences.

After reading the parts of the excerpt, I too felt guilty about about the climate change inequality.  Just the fact that some populations and societies that have done little to no impact contributing to the climate crisis (or might not even currently know about it) is really sad. I also like how you pointed out how the rich contribute the most to the climate crisis. As a society, I feel that we need to pressure the government more to contain the vast irresponsibility caused by the climate crisis, as the rest of the population (and the world) will suffer.

In reading "Be The Change" I felt a connection to the author. Peter Kalmus' appeal to emotion is much more persuasive than any other reading we have done which just throws facts and numbers at us. In a very pragmatic tone, Kalmus conceded to the fact that to change to an environmentally friendly lifestyle in which you sacrifice many of the convenient commodities for the purpose of saving the planet is unrealistic. Kalmus says that the change of lifestyle could only work if there was a genuine interests that fuels it. This reading presents many call to actions and even brings the idea of taking action into question. "Be The Change" is inspiring, but what resonated with me the most was its honesty. This course has made me feel firm in my belief that individual change is not as easy nor efficient as it is proposed to be.

I agree with you that Kalmus’ emotional appeal is very persuasive. The numbers give it credibility, but when it comes to actually making these decisions to live more sustainably, you have to want to change. Kalmus does not lie and say that getting rid of some of our technology is actually convenient for our current lifestyles. He writes about the inconvenience of switching to a sustainable lifestyle: having to air dry and hand wash clothes, not being able to drive your car or travel by plane, or eat the things that you enjoy. It is not an easy change to make, but in the long run we will be glad we persisted. Individual change is not what some people make it out to be, but it can truly make a difference.

Both the book and the documentary I watched before introduced ways of the Kalmus’taking actions in their daily life to reduce energy using/ wasting to reduce their carbon footprints in the end. I have to say, if I haven’t watched the documentary before reading the chapters, I might find difficult understanding what exact actions he takes to achieve the target of controlling family’s CO2 emission. Taking less plane travel might be hard for me since I need to go back home during long breaks, driving less is not considered in my life since I don’t have the license yet. What drives my attention is how he can insist doing that in his daily life and makes his whole family doing the same. The only way you can make people being involved in the change is to be the change first and continuously yourself. I really admired his actions and I do agree we need more people, whether considered themselves as activists or not, to be the change, from every little aspect of daily lives.

This reading material and last week’s documentary are comprehensive. They covered a lot of information about what people can do to protect the environment. Some of the solutions may be hard to achieve, but they are meaningful. Taking less airplane? That I can do. I won’t choose airplane to travel between LA and Boston. The airplane tickets are expensive, and it leaves a lot of carbon footprint. The Amtrak will be a better choice although it never runs on time. Accepting a diet that tends to be vegetarian is healthier and more eco-friendly than eating too much meat. And, there are a lot more people can do to mitigate the climate crisis, as shown in this article and the previous documentary.



</span></div><hr>

<p>
When reading the chapter in "Being the Change" regarding Peter's own reduction in fossil fuel use, a lot of the changes that he made really stuck out to me. For example , Peter states that the consumption of food was previously his second-largest climate impact, due to all of the fuel, fertilizers and deforestation associated with the average American diet.  After switching to Vegetarianism, Peter says that he reduced his emissions by about 1,500 kg CO2e per year, and additionally that a switch to "freeganism" reduced his food emissions by an additional 1,000 kg CO2e per year. These are massive emissions savings, and they come from areas that the average consumer never even sees. To me, a change in diet is one of the easiest ways each of us can reduce our carbon footprint, and it can have other positive effects as well. Peter states that he "personally prefers vegetarianism," and I believe that if done correctly, a vegetarian or vegan diet can be much healthier and more enjoyable than one that contains large amounts of emission-heavy foods like meat.
   <br><br>


Additionally, Peter's chapter on collective action included several points that really resonated with me. For example,  he mentions a successful carbon tax that was implemented in British Columbia, which gave me great hope that something similar could be used in California, or even someday in the entire United States. Peter states that the tax was "revenue-neutral" and thus as it increased over time, taxes on the citizens of British Columbia were lowered. Now, British Columbia has the lowest personal income tax rate in Canada, as well as one of the lowest corporate tax rates in North America. To me, a major reduction in taxes seems like amazing incentives for anyone to vote for a carbon tax, even if you don't truly care about helping the environment. Overall, I think that Peter is correct in his support of a modest carbon tax, and that we really should try to implement something similar in the U.S.

I completely agree with you that switching to a plant-based diet is the easiest way to significantly reduce personal greenhouse gas emissions. About 6 months ago I chose to go vegan, and I absolutely love it. My diet isn’t perfect, and I still “cheat” with the occasional dairy product, but I feel so good about my decision and I don’t think I’ll ever go back to eating large amounts of animal products. My body feels better, my brain feels clearer, and every time I choose not to eat an animal product, I think of it as climate activism, which feels extremely empowering. However, one thing that I got from Peter's book, and from Ken, is that I need to address my spending habits. Coming from a low-income household and never having much material wealth, I definitely fall below the average Americans annual spending of $6,000 per year. Yet I am still at fault for buying a plethora of things that I really just don’t need. I fully intend to cut back on spending, while trying to shop locally, and thrift rather than buying new. What I enjoyed most about Peter's movie and book, is how he demonstrated what life could look like without fossil fuels, and it looked pretty darn wholesome and inviting.

I believe Peter Kalmus's "Being the Change" was much more effective than the documentary. While meditation and the spiritual aspect of the climate crisis is important to me, it easily turns people away from this issue. Not everyone is willing to adopt meditation but would be willing to stop flying. I think the book is more effective because it sticks to the facts and numbers which is more likely to influence people to make a change. Overall most of the changes that Kalmus made seem feasible. Where I don't think freeganism or humanure will be widely practiced, most of the other changes could easily gain popularity. Solar energy is already being adopted by a large amount of people, as is vegetarianism. I would be interested in trying to compost my own food waste as well as line-drying clothes. While I mainly bike everywhere at UCSB, I would like to try to incorporate biking and public transportation more when I go home for breaks. Kalmus is very inspiring and I like how he shows how to have an efficient home without spending thousands of dollars on new technology. He challenges the idea of consumerism which I think is very important in the fight against the climate crisis.



</p><hr>


<p>

The top five most effective actions, according to Peter Kalmus, are to quit riding airplanes, vegetarianism, bicyclism, freeganism, and composting. But what I appreciate the most is his acknowledgement of human behavior and what we want. He understands that we all want happiness and sees how we fall short even when consistently consuming. He sees how this negatively impacts ourselves and the environment and as a result, he prompts taking action to turn life around.
   <br><br>

I liked both the film and this reading. I think the film served well as an anecdote, testifying what Peter Kalmus and his family are doing and exemplifying personal action. This reading allows readers on how they can combat the climate crisis in their own way, highlighting different acts they may adopt. I really like how he quantified aspects of the climate crisis. For example, he provided directions on how to calculate one’s greenhouse gas emissions and also had graphs and images to display the impact of daily activities.
   <br><br>

There were crazy facts that I learned. For example, an average American’s diet can emit 3 metric tons. This already blows over one individual’s expected CO2 allotment for the entire year. What more with their need to fly? Or to drive to places? To turn the lights on? To turn the heater or air-conditioning on? To accomodate, we need to move towards better eating habits and less waste. That way, we would be able to still meet our other needs without being reckless or inconsiderate.
   <br><br>

Another interesting fact is how one dollar is half a kilogram of embodied CO2 emissions  which includes the processes of manufacturing, shipping, and purchasing. This just comes to show how our society is structured in a way that emits way too many greenhouse gases into our atmosphere than necessary. Consequently, we must revamp how we live our lives. In his film, Kalmus highlighted how he was able to take action all to compensate for maintaining other necessities that aren’t as eco-friendly. This reading underscores the importance of coming together for a larger, common goal: to protect our environment.

After watching "leaving fossil fuel", I learned that one of the fastest ways to make the earth warm is to fly. In the article, the author mentioned that he reduced the number of times he took the plane and made the bicycle his main means of transportation. After that, he reduced the consumption of food, became a vegetarian and began to grow some vegetables himself. The author also mentioned that reducing one's carbon footprint has little effect on the climate crisis. The main reason why we need to take some practical actions to reduce the carbon footprint is that as long as there are enough people to take action together, it is to cause cultural change. In the climate crisis, culture plays a decisive role. It can change the whole world's view of the climate crisis and even affect our daily life. In this way, we can solve the problem fundamentally and solve the climate crisis. In the "collective action" after that, the author introduces many programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The essence of these programs is to restrict people through policies and laws, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and to reduce people's dependence on meat products, fossil fuels, and other commodities. Fundamentally, it is also a cultural change.

Before taking this class, I always thought it was impossible to basically reverse what we have done because I thought that this small percentage of people won't do much to change the direction we're heading towards. But I realized that culture change is the only way we can combat climate change. The reason why it is so hard to change people's habits is because we've been living this with these habits since the day we were born. If we made these changes to seem like a norm, we can ultimately reach the point of culture change for the better of the planet.


<br><Hr>
“Being the Change” also changed some ideas in my head for me because it also showed how a normal man changed his life in different ways and made a huge impact, in terms of one person. I thought it was really nice how he provided a chart for readers to do math, if they want to calculate the emissions of our life. Looking at it made me realize how much my emissions have gone down since I have entered college. Without everyday car emissions, and less air travel as I drive from home to school without going on actual vacations, my emissions are already cut down by ⅔. 
   <br><br>
“Collective Action”, a chapter within the book, gave many more statistics, as it showed how the government could battle climate change. The ideas showed protocols, as well as fees. Connecting the content I am learning in this class to what I’ve learned about economics, fees and taxes are always more efficient than environmental standards to cut down carbon emissions. I considered this information while reading this chapter and the knowledge really helped me see what methods would be effective and which ones wouldn’t. Even with this hypothetical political action and government intervention, the climate crisis will still continue unless we rearrange almost every aspect of our lives. That is something the government cannot force onto us. To rearrange our lives and the economy, we need our willingness to make these changes as well be backed up by the government. We have a long time until we get there, but as urgency increases hopefully action will too.

These two chapters are deptually insightful. It's almost like a climate change Bible (haha). Kalamus states, "Your life is different from mine, and you must understand the idiosyncrasies of your own situation before you can take meaningful action." Ever since taking this course, I have felt overwhelmed in all the things I should be doing but are not doing. Then I realized...I'm vegetarian, I ride my bike like everywhere ( I don't even have a car...or a license...don't laugh at me), I have been limiting myself to take one thing at a time in the dining commons, and majority of my clothes shopping is secondhand...I am doing my best with where I am at. I am definitely not settling, though. I took time to actually reflect on what I have been doing and what I am doing. Thank you, Peter. 

   <br><br>

Peter also mentions cognitive dissonance. I have been looking for a feeling to describe why I keep thinking of climate change every time I do something like hop in a car. I end up trying to convince myself that it's not that bad. 
   <br><br>


Anyways, Peter does an amazing job of laying these solutions out to us in a clear and concise manner. For people who are not totally convinced on personal action or have no idea where to start, this read can be extremely helpful. Of course, as a scientist, he gives us cold, hard facts. Imagine trying to get into an argument about climate change with him...God, you would be destroyed. In addition, these steps go far beyond the become-a-vegan-and-ride-a-bicycle mechanisms. Peter gives you exact solutions, what they result in, and how to do them. While being scientific, he uses anecdotes, making this issue personal (which it should be) and easy for the everyday person to digest. He shows us that not only are these actions feasible, he has done them himself. He does not shy away from the critiques of so-called solutions though. He calls out the Paris Agreement and cap-and-trade. But he doesn’t stop with critique, he proposes what you AND the government can do to solve this issue. I find it extremely interesting..all these answers in very short chapters, yet we aren’t doing anything? WOW. LAME. Let's get to it.

I really liked this week's reading. I found out how to calculate my carbon footprint and I'm honestly embarrassed at how high it is. I know people who have even higher footprints because they are active flyers. It just showed me how privileged all of us Americans are. People in developing countries don't even come close to our carbon footprints. Climate change isn't fair to anyone in developing countries or to the animals on this planet. The developed countries are the cause of climate change, so we need to be the ones to make the change first. We can't just sit around and wait for someone to save the planet. We can start today by deciding not to fly and using public transportation more often. 
   <br><br>
This reading also showed me that there is simple stuff I can do to help like wasting less and eating less meat. I am already starting to do that. I can also give up flying which I rarely do anyway. I take the bus or walk almost everywhere. The only time I am in a car is when I go home. I sent this week's reading to my family so that they can see just how much we contribute to climate change.

Krista, props to you for calculating your carbon footprint! I'm honestly scared to but I'm planning on sitting down sometime this week and doing the math. I just remember taking a quiz online (I can't recall what it was called) that helped you calculate how many single-use plastics you were using every year -- and yeah those results were very very convicting. I do think it's crucial for people to know just how much they're contributing to this crisis. I also think its important to be able to see concrete reductions in numbers when we make a change. People don't stick to things well without clear signs of progress. Knowing just how many gigatons of CO2 you chose not to release into the atmosphere by making one easy change is incredibly important, highly unlikely as an ability among most people, and effective in getting people to keep cutting their emissions. I am glad Peter included a clear way to calculate these numbers, though I realized looking at it that I wasn't aware enough about my daily actions to be able to calculate my own right away. That was scary because it showed me just how mindlessly I waste resources, emit carbon and go about my habits day to day. 
   <br><br>

I also appreciate Peter's introduction to the carbon fee through a description of global warming as "market failure." I thought this was a very interesting point that isn't made very often: that burning fossil fuels has way more costs on society than benefits, all things considered. In a world that often views global warming through an economic lens and perceives it to be counter-profit and difficult to resolve in a capitalist society, this statement that burning fossil fuels is the least economically sound decision in the long run is very powerful. 
   <br><br>

Finally, the part of the reading that stuck out the most to me was Peter's 3 reasons to reduce your carbon emissions that DOESN'T have to do with the impossible and depressing task of trying to reduce global emissions by reducing your own. As he states, one person cannot save the planet and making lifestyle changes with this goal in mind will only lead to frustration and failure. Instead, he says that we should reduce our emissions with the goal of enjoyment in mind. He says, and shows in the documentary from last week, that life is MORE enjoyable without fossil fuel! The changes that need to be made are fun and allow for more time with family and friends. Second, it is a way for us to align our actions with our principles. It feels good and fulfills us to "walk the talk," and not create dissonance in our lives by doing actions we know is bad or harmful. Finally, when we reduce our emissions we inspire all those around us to do the same: creating a ripple effect that very well may save the planet.

This week’s reading was one of my favorite ones because not only did Peter address the issue of climate change but he gave possible solutions to this crisis and he was also honest on how his past lifestyle contributed to CO2 emission without realizing it and what he is doing differently now to reduce his carbon footprint. It was very refreshing to read how an actual scientist alters their lifestyle for the better of the plant. When I read that many academics had to fly to attend their conference I wasn’t surprised, however what surprised me was when Peter explained that him and his colleagues fly more than 100,000 miles per year! The irony was that climate scientists were part of this number as well. You would think that they fly less or emit less carbon emission, but no it was opposite. Another thing that shocked me was when I learned that one person’s trash releases more CO2 than the average Bangladesh generates for everything. To even think how much CO2 is emitted with every single person’s trash combined is mind-boggling! I really appreciated how Peter included a section in chapter 9 on how to estimate our own emission. Even though I already know that my carbon emission number is large, calculating the exact amount is scary but eye-opening. It helps you realize how much your own personal actions do have a huge impact on our planet. Furthermore, in chapter 13, Peter stated a fact that I deeply agree with. International cooperation is needed ASAP. People need to stop pointing fingers at who is responsible for climate change when ALL OF US are. Therefore, it is our responsibility to change that. Peter is right, the US loves to brag about their leadership and how they’re an example, yet when it comes to actually fighting what’s important and helping out, the US stays very quiet.

I completely agree with your response; I too found the readings incredibly refreshing.  Prepared to read another pessimistic piece, I found the author to be very informative and positive about each individual’s ability to lessen their carbon footprint, leading with a description of how he was able to change his own.  In my opinion, this is the type of change that needs to happen.  Although the climate crisis sounds too big to escape, there are very real solutions that will work if everyone can get on board with it.  However, the issue is that not many people are willing to revolutionize their lifestyle in order to retract their small percentage of global CO2 emissions, even though the people who emit the most CO2 could make the changes most easily.  I think that if the most wealthy, powerful people committed to reducing their carbon footprint it would be enough to change the structure of the entire economy.  Imagine if the CEO’s of massive corporations encouraged sustainable transportation and provided compensation to those that biked or walked or took the bus to work.  Imagine if fossil fuel companies used their money to restore the natural earth and produce sustainable energy sources.  Imagine if schools taught that the way to be happy was to live in the moment and preserve the earth as it is.  Although I completely agree that a carbon fee is the most efficient and predictable way to keep the climate crisis at bay, I can not see a way that it is enacted with the urgency it needs to.  With the population having to vote on the bill, the wealthy class will attempt to sway it to failure because they will be most impacted by it.  If the people with the most power commit to sustainability, the world will follow.

As we have seen in past reading, things like Project Drawdown need to be enacted on a global level. Peter Kalmus, in "Being the Change," however, looks at what we as individuals do. Quitting planes, freeganism, bicycling are just some of the lifestyle changes that he implemented that greatly reduced his personal footprint. Our society still hasn’t stopped using fossil fuels. Not everyone will move away from them unless they are forced to, so I think this must be done. Kalmus gives us reasons why we need to change our own personal lifestyles though, until this wide change can be enacted. 
   <br><br>

It is crazy that “globally, only about 5% of humans have ever flown.” This really puts into perspective the fact that most people will never fly in a plane, and I do not think of it as that big of a deal. This is so sad. I did not realize that I am apart of the top percents that emit huge amounts of harmful gasses into the environment when I would go on my band’s annual school trip. This really shows me how much I personally have to work on, and that is why I think the approach of personal action is so important. Also, I was sad to read that “There’s little interest in teleconferencing” because it sounds like such a genius idea. It just is not practical to fly somewhere to talk for twenty minutes. I do not understand how that became a normalized practice, because it doesn’t make any sense. 
   <br><br>

 I also love that he had ways to estimate your own emissions. I think that this would be helpful for many people who are curious about how much change their lifestyle shifts are making. His approach through personal action is very important. He underscores the fact that while there is systemic change that must be enacted, we as individuals can and must do what we can to help the environment with lifestyle changes.



</p><hr>


<p>
After reading the two chapters from Peter Kalmus’s book Being the Change and connecting it with the documentary of the same name that we watched last week, I have learned multiple ways of incorporating personal actions to mitigate the climate crisis into our daily lives and that we as ordinary citizens of the planet can make changes and positive differences in our environment. While reading through the assigned chapters from Kalmus’s book for this week, I remembered parts of the documentary where Kalmus mentioned the changes he made to his personal life and to his family life in order to reduce their overall carbon footprint on the planet. It was initially pretty unbelievable and astonishing to me to see the dramatic amount of carbon dioxide that Kalmus had cut down from 2012 to 2014 in such a little amount of time as two years. I even doubted the legitimacy of the statistics he outlined in the book at first because I honestly did not think that it was possible to reduce our personal carbon emission into the atmosphere in such a short time span. At least I did not think that I would be able to do it or any other citizens in the country would because we are not scientists and we do not have the sense of advanced knowledge towards or know about climate change and the science behind it enough to cut down our carbon footprint so quickly. 
   <br><br>


However, when I actually read the tips and ways that Kalmus and his family adopted in order to reduce their carbon emission, I had to take my previous words back because everything they did was so easy and simple to achieve in our own lives and that I could try one or two of them even living on campus in college. For example, the Kalmus family rarely drives and uses bikes as their main form of transportation, and this is something that all of us can do. Biking is an ideal transportation method because it not only cuts down our personal carbon footprint but is also a great workout for many of us including students and office workers who sit for the majority of their days and do not get up to move around as much. I have never biked around to school or work before coming to UCSB and I only started biking this quarter to classes and I am really glad to see how much biking has changed my life here on-campus in a positive way. I can get to classes faster and on-time while getting an awesome leg workout as I can feel my legs getting fit from biking. Before this quarter I had never biked before and I used to have some negative conceptions towards biking such as that it does not look as cool as driving. Now that I am taking this class and I am beginning to see the pressure and pollution driving automobiles is putting on our already-burdened environment, I will consider biking to work and school back home more and I really enjoy the exhilaration and the exercise I gain from biking everyday. 

   <br><br>

Another lifestyle change that the Kalmus family adopts is freeganism, or consuming the clean, untouched food usually wasted by restaurants and supermarkets. Food waste is a huge issue in the U.S. as well as in the world. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, an estimated 1.3 billion tonnes of food produced is wasted globally each year, which is around one-third or 33% of all food produced for human consumption. This is a staggering number to me because it is very difficult for me to imagine that this enormous amount of food produced is being wasted every year, and all the food we wasted would end up in landfills which would emit a great amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere from all the wasted food disposed there as the food will not decompose for a long time. 

   <br><br>

By adopting freeganism, we can effectively reduce the amount of carbon emission into the atmosphere resulting from food waste and landfills because some of the wasted food destined to be disposed of in the landfills will travel back to our dinner tables and provide nutrients for us. Some might say that it is a gross idea to eat food literally coming from a trashcan or from a waste bin in the restaurants and supermarkets. But just like how Peter Kalmus showed us in the documentary and delineated in his book, a majority of the food wasted is edible, clean and healthy as restaurants and supermarkets have a high demand for raw food materials as they would throw away a whole carton of eggs if one of them is broken or throw away a whole box of apples if one of them has gone bad even if all the other eggs in the carton and all the other apples in the box are in good condition.

I totally agree with the ease with some of the swaps that Kalmus made to reduce his emissions. Biking everywhere, freeganism, and vegetarianism can save us time and money while also improving our health. I have worked on biking more places now such as biking to get my groceries from the co-op and only going to a farther store once a month for items I can only get there. This has reduced my emissions since I am buying more locally and not driving as much. 
   <br><br>


The thing that is very hard though for a lot of Peter's changes, especially freeganism and biking is the lack of infrastructure to support both. Dumpster diving is illegal in many places because it constitutes trespassing on private property. And biking, as has been mentioned numerous times in this class lacks the infrastructure to be feasible for many due to safety concerns. I would love to create a program, there might already be one, that allows grocery stores and restaurants to post the food they are getting rid of and allow people to come to pick it up for free or at a severely reduced price. This would make freeganism far less time-intensive and also less of a risk to those that would ultimately benefit. 
   <br><br>
I won't get too much into biking since it has been talked about a ton, but I have struggled to carry lots of stuff with me while I bike. I realize that this may be in part because of the fact that I have a fixie bike, but I don't want to give up the ease and speed of biking to get a slower and bulkier bike. If anyone has a solution for that besides getting a front bike basket I would most definitely be all ears.

This week’s reading put a lot of things into perspective for me. I never really thought about the numbers that come from my own personal carbon footprint. After reading chapter 9, I came to the realization that there are plenty of small steps that we can take to reduce our emissions. Some of the examples included are drying clothes using a wire rather than a dryer, growing your own food and trading surpluses with neighbors instead of buying it, switching to renewable options, freeganism, limiting shopping, etc. Something else that was noted in the chapter is the way that humans try to rationalize their use of fossil fuels. For example, a lady mentioned how she flies to Africa to help women over there with child births and is now conflicted because she cares deeply about both issues. The author’s response is to move to the community and be immersed into it as this allows them to really serve the people they are trying to help because they get to know them. He then states that if someone is unwilling to move to a place where they are trying to make a difference, then they should start in their neighborhood. I agree that change should happen in our own community first, because there are plenty of people in close proximity that are in need of help. However, I also believe that other countries deserve to have access to healthcare professionals, but there needs to be a better way to do things than to have people fly over there.
   <br><br>
The other reading highlights the importance of people speaking up and coming together collectively to bring about change. One way that we can help save the environment is by imposing a carbon tax, where people are forced to give up their lavish lifestyles because things that emit more CO2 into the atmosphere will be taxed. This will be good for everyone because it will limit the amount of fossil fuel burned and the foods that will be cheaper are the ones that are good for people’s health. They also include other ideas like having half the Earth for humans and the other for other earthlings. Thy emphasized the change that we need to make because the climate crisis is serious and needs immediate action, and this is coming from the people with the most expertise on the subject matter, scientists.

I was also shocked at looking at numerical estimations of my own carbon footprint, but also surprised at things I already do that are more environmentally friendly like air drying my clothes. I have always wanted to grow my own food and can’t wait till I am in a position in life where I get to do that. The lady who conflicted about flying to Africa to help women birth babies and the environmental impact that has really stuck out to me as well. I think that people should start in their own community but I think helping in other parts of the world is important especially as an advanced country it is important to keep that kind of connection. If it was once a month that would be a little much and I think from there you focus on fewer larger trips rather than many small trips. I agree with you so much that countries deserve access to medical professionals and I think we should care beyond our own communities and do whatever we can to make a difference in every area. I have always supported carbon taxes, it just makes sense because it is a cost on society. Maybe that is just me econ major part of my brain but if there is a cost beyond the financial manufacturing aspect (there always almost is) then people should be taxed for that especially if the community or other people are paying the cost. And they are in terms of their health and their planet.

I really enjoyed reading Being the Change and I thought many of Kalmus’s arguments were well researched and very compelling. The most interesting thing I read was the section on the revenue neutral carbon fees. I had only ever heard of Cap and Trade or Carbon taxes, but never this idea of having a fee per ton of C02 emitted and having a dividend for every citizen using those fees. I think it is an amazing idea that could be very effective, because 1) it will cause people to use considerably less fossil fuels, 2) it will incentivise the corporation and business sector to transfer to renewables and sustainable practices, and 3) it ensures that the poor are not disproportionately affected, because the less C02, you use the more money you net gain after the dividends are divided. I can only hope that we can enact this policy and quickly, because it seems like anything else remains so far out of reach politically, and it was nice to hear Kalmus explain that both sides of the political spectrum are potentially for this type of policy. I think that huge system changes can be overwhelming to think about, but concrete solutions such as this one give me immense hope that if we educate enough people that this is a good thing, and a necessary thing, then we have a chance at continually bettering the relationship that humans have with the planet.

As soon as I read the first few lines of your comment I knew I had to respond. You're absolutely right, the section on the revenue neutral carbon tax was very interesting. Just like a carbon tax, it would lead to people consuming less fossil fuel products but beyond that it would lead to major companies to use less fossil fuel as their main source of energy. But by far the most important issue that this solution tackles is the fact that it would affect people of all income brackets equally. I personally felt that this article was very well backed up by findings and less about the author's opinion which i liked a lot.

<p>

I like how Kalmus makes a point in the chapter “Leaving fossil fuel” that the reader’s emissions and his emissions will be different and that in general, everyone’s carbon footprint will vary. Although Kalmus does speak from a place of privilege by being able to do things like ride his bike to work, I admire the sacrifices that he does take for the sake of reducing his emissions. As Kalmus explains, many climate scientists must travel for work conferences, thus racking up over 100,000 miles per year. For someone who has to travel that much, the most convenient and comfortable way is to fly, but Kalmus gives up the efficiency of air travel to reduce his footprint. 

   <br><br>

A quote from the reading that resonated with me is, “awareness is the soil out of which change grows” because it lets readers know how simple, yet profound being aware and spreading awareness are. As Kalmus admitted, he just felt wrong taking a flight after he knew the truth about its’ emissions. I had the same unease when I would eat animal products after watching Cowspiracy. For some people, it’s just about hearing the facts for the first time to implement change which means it could be considered a responsibility for those of us who know about the climate crisis to inform others so that we can change collectively. 

   <br><br>

I’m reading Kalmus’ chapter “Collective Action” on Super Tuesday which is fitting since Kalmus stresses the importance of demanding action and making space for policymakers. The way Kalmus makes it understood that citizens are the ones who can create political space is empowering and motivating especially for those who weren’t originally “a political person”. When it comes to voting, I’ve heard many people express that essentially, their vote doesn’t matter because they’re just one person. Kalmus interprets why he gets involved in advocacy by saying it gives him satisfaction and “It’s true that I’m only one voice, and I have little control over collective outcomes. But even while I wish I could do more, I’m doing all that I can— and contributing to something much larger than myself” which I think is frankly, a beautiful and mindful way to look at it. Becoming active in the community or working in any way to shed light on the climate crisis is both selfish and selfless in the best ways. Most people who do get involved are known to be happier and more satisfied while they are helping and working on a collective initiative, so it can be seen as a win-win situation.

I think your attention on the quote,  “awareness is the soil out of which change grows” is really hits the spot of the whole climate change crisis. It really is quite simple and readily available for everyone to take part in change, changing our current way of life for the future of the climate. Being aware of the crisis and of one's own role, in either extending the crisis or helping it, is definitely the first and foremost simple step. If one is not aware of the events that are happening around them and their own impact on their surroundings, how will they change for the better? Therefore, I think your interpretation of this quote is very spot on.
   <br><br>
I also agree with you on the "Collective Action" chapter, in which Kalmus stresses the importance of demanding action from policymakers and representatives. This class has repeatedly stressed the importance of taking personal action as a way to actively contribute in helping the crisis, as well as urging others to take action. The biggest actions to take would definitely be from our government, which can implement the carbon fees and taxes that Kalmus advocates for. Voting is, like you said, definitely one way to contribute to something larger that oneself and to be more involved and active in the community regarding the climate crisis.

<br><hr>
I agree with Kalmus and Vanessa in that awareness is what enacts change. Like both of you have mentioned, once one is aware of the negative impacts of their actions, they are less likely to pursue them. Kalmus claims when one does something against their moral beliefs it creates cognitive dissonance. He then goes on to say that when one fails to be aware of their conflicting actions and beliefs, they make excuses or choose to be in denial. Therefore, it is hard to inspire change in those who neglect their moral conflicts and contradictions. Perhaps the only way to combat this is to make social norms of fossil fuels consumption become taboo via activism. If this were the case, then it would be much harder to escape the cognitive dissonance one holds as society holds the individual more accountable, making them feel shameful. To tie it into what Vanessa acknowledges, if we, the public make fracking and other carbon emitting/ environmentally unethical policies taboo, no one will vote for these politics. Each and every person should then speak their mind over the current state of the planet and how they hope we can keep it pure for future generations and species so we can reverse these social norms and protect the Earth.

Like Ken said, this week’s reading reminded me of project drawdown. I appreciate information in lists which I why I loved project drawdown, and thus I liked how Peter separated his different paragraphs and issues. Most of his facts and life changes I learned from the film last week, but there was definitely more detail and room for expansion in the reading. I like how he mentioned before he began to make changes he first had to understand the sources of his climate impact. He then examined his life and made estimates on everything he did that produced greenhouse gases. He even said making these changes felt like a fun and engaging game, and he was happier because of them. Yet, just like I felt at first Peter felt as if his own personal reductions weren’t going to make an impact, and it was “Like trying to save the world all by myself.” I’ve felt this frustration too, and it was hard to keep trying to change my habits when I felt my small life wouldn't help the climate crisis at all. Yet, like Peter I realized personal reductions do help. Even if indirectly, I too have found that my choices have had an influence on people in my life. 
   <br><br>

I’m not much of a numbers person, but I did expect and appreciate all the facts he presented to back his claims. The second chapter we read was more important to me, because he elaborated on personal changes we can make. Peter even mentioned things I hadn’t really thought of or labeled, such as rethinking global trade, and reserving half of the earth for nonhumans. He is obviously a very educated and intelligent person, and I enjoyed this reading.

I also liked how Kalmus organized his carbon footprint and reduction methods. He hits all major sources of greenhouse gas emissions including air travel, car travel, food, electricity, stuff, waste, public transportation, etc. I appreciate his determination to figure out what his carbon footprint was and acting to decrease it. I have yet to do such a thorough investigation into my climate footprint, but I would have to estimate that the majority of it comes from driving and food. In this year alone, I estimated that I’ve driven about 1500 miles, using 50 gallons of gas. At the end of 2020, assuming I have the same driving patterns, I estimate I would use 250 gallons of gas, emitting 2800 kg of carbon dioxide. That’s a very rough estimate, I could very well emit more. 2800 kg is 2.8 metric tons, so by the end of the year, I would have used up my years’ worth of emissions in driving alone. 
    <br><br>

My emissions from food won’t be any better. As I still eat meat, though not very often, I will still use the upper bound that Kalmus provides, therefore, I emit about 3 metric tons due to production. From driving and food, I emit about 6 metric tons of carbon per year. I’m sure if I were to calculate all my emissions, it wouldn’t be far from the average. Kalmus overall has a great approach to figuring out his carbon footprint. Through continuing reflecting on my carbon footprint, I would like to continue to decrease my footprint.



<br><hr>
I liked the reading a lot more than the film, as I think it gave a more direct message that is easier to follow. It is honestly very simple to make the changes that peter described, like being vegan or freegan. I myself have done this and found it to not be that difficult. It has also presented me with more benefits than just helping the environment, as I have more energy, my skin is better, and I feel happier overall. Just the action of knowing that I'm making a difference is enough for me though. I thought about this a lot when watching the “Happy” documentary. A lot of the actions that help climate change go hand in hand with actions that lead to more overall happiness. A lot of this is devoting yourself to something other than yourself. Helping others and the environment is very rewarding and not difficult. You often don’t have to give up much to do so. Even though personal actions don’t seem like they have a huge impact, they actually do. Just making small changes in my life has encouraged those around me to do the same. As mentioned in the reading from last week, it doesn’t solve anything to be obnoxious about your actions to help the environment, simply doing them is enough to get people’s attention. I too find it to be kind of a “game” to do things that help the environment. It gives me a better sense of purpose and action. It's easy to feel lost in the whole climate change issue, and I often feel like there's nothing I can do to help. But changing small things in my life has helped me feel like I actually can do somethings and have an influence. I think if more people realized that doing good for others and the Earth would actually benefit them more than they think, more people would probably do it.

Peter Kalmus's reading made me realize how much fossil fuels were burned with activities I didn't even notice. When I throw something away, I'm not aware of the consequences of my actions. Everything I throw away will expand my carbon footprint.

I think that,  like UCSB, many places should have the option to compost. In fact, I think that we culturally should stigmatize throwing stuff away. We should thrive to be zero-waste, of as little waste as possible. 
   <br><br>

We need to transition from single use items to items that can me reused. If something has to be single use, it should be biodegradable or compostable, like a paper straw. We need to stop relying on landfills. Landfills seem so unnatural  to me. Why should we waste a large portion of the Earth to holding our own trash. No other species does this. 
   <br><br>

Americans should implement a trash tax, where we're taxed on the weight of our trash, and that money goes to implementing a composting program (where you can have your compost taken by a truck to be composted locally) and to investing in business that attempt to keep our landfills empty.

I think your trash program is brilliant! Before taking climate science courses at UCSB, I used to think it was a noble act for me to donate my unwanted clothes every year, when in actuality, the single fact that I even have to "donate" annually is a sign that I have too many clothes and that the clothes I buy are impulse purchases. Thankfully I now know how much the climate is suffering and the consequences of my actions. However, for people who do not know the consequences of their actions or just don't care, the trash program can be very effective in discouraging wastefulness and mindless consumption.



<br><hr>
The trash tax sounds like a good plan, it should help on the consumer side a lot. and If people are actively avoiding single-use plastic, companies will eventually fall in line. I think maybe one big issue is - what happens until then?
   <br><br>


I think it will ultimately be the most helpful to enforce this on the producer side. I know it's not as feel-good as individual action, but I think it would help spur on personal growth to feel like there was a national movement that was working together to fight the climate crisis by reducing single-use plastic. I think we can all acknowledge, especially if we've physically been near one, that landfills are the worst thing ever. I get so sad when I get dumb gifts I know I won't use, because I know that I can't reuse them myself, an even if I can pawn them off at some point, the likelihood is that they'll end up in a trash heap.

   <br><br>

I would love to see single-use plastic eliminated. I love owing reusable bags that have some personality, and seeing fruit free-floating on a stand. I wish nothing came in a plastic box.

In this week's reading of leaving fossil fuels Peter Kalmus discusses the ways that he was personally able to bring down his and his families overall emissions by a factor of 10. As noted by Ken, Peter stopped flying, started biking, went vegan/freegan, and composted. In response to Ken's question the ones that interested me the most while reading were the flying  and composting. Sense I have already discussed in the other sections I have maintained a vegan diet i will not commit to that. What I loved about reading his section on flying is how he has truly taken a stand against flying because of the huge impacts it has on the planet. I would be what is considered a frequent flyer. Growing up with divorced parents and having a father that lived in Arizona I frequently flew out to see him when I was younger. Before Kens lecture on flying I had honestly never given it much of a thought and did not consider the environmental impacts that it has on the planet. However, after taking this class i've really been trying to change my way of thinking and no longer want to partake in flying that isn't absolutely necessary and if allowable i will take slow travel. I particularly appreciated Peter's message about flying when he related it back to his children and the hypocrisy of his actions. I think this is the kind of outlook that others that do fly frequently, say for business, need to think about. With new telecommunication technologies many business professionals could use something like Skype to do business. After reading his section on waste and how he actively compost I really started looking into it and found that there are ways to compost even without having a large yard like Peter. I'm looking to implement composting into my daily life and found that there are places in Isla Vista where you can drop off your compost. 
   <br><br>
 The second reading for this week was another chapter in Peters book on collective action. I thought this chapter on collective action was really helpful in that it clearly explains the downside to the cape-and-trade deal and explains why a carbon tax would be better. I thought his small section on half-earth was really interesting. I'm not optimistic that something like this will be adopted in the U.S considering some are still struggling to accept the climate crisis we are currently in. Nevertheless I thought it was a really interesting proposition and I respect his dedication to bringing back the issue regarding animal rights. 
   <br><br>
Overall I really enjoyed reading these two chapters from Peter's book. I think the way he approaches climate change  issues from both an scientific and holistic perspective is very inspirational.

This reading really brought together a lot of topics we have spent time looking at this quarter. While we have had weeks devoted to lifestyle change, airplanes, and transportation, I thought this reading distilled what we have learned into basic facts that drive home the points made in other videos and readings. Even though we had previously learned about the incredible extent that airplanes hurt our environment, reading it again reminded me of this point and I was still astonished by the impact that a single traveler is responsible for. Additionally, by integrating the science behind air travel's emissions impact with his personal story of phasing such travel out of his life, this piece left me feeling a bit more inclined to seriously consider reducing or eliminating non-essential plane trips. After previous times we had studied air travel, I still couldn't see myself changing my habits, even though I did acknowledge the negative effects. This was due to the fact that I saw air travel as such an integral part of my life. However, Kalmus's anecdote about how he finally gave up air travel regardless of its effect on his life due to its environmental costs showed how some people have actually been able to make such drastic changes. 
   <br><br>
By analyzing the different regular contributors to an individual's CO2 footprint in one piece, I think Kalmus was effective at showing how CO2 emissions are the result of an interconnected web of causes and effects that result from a lifestyle based around consumerism and consumption. For instance, issues relating to air travel and car emissions both stem from our culture, as we cannot imagine taking longer to get somewhere. Kalmus in this piece shows how a lifestyle change such as biking instead of driving actually has positive psychological effects as well as environmental ones. I think this aspect of the piece helps contribute to some of the major ideas in this course, such as the fact that climate action needs to include broad cultural change and that such changes can lead to positive results in a variety of areas beyond saving the climate.

After reading, “Leaving Fossil Fuels” and “Collective Action” by Peter Kalmus I found myself feeling a bit more optimistic about there perhaps being a change to address the climate crisis. In “Leaving the Fossil Fuel'' Peter discusses the ways he personally reduced his carbon emissions significantly. He focused on five major changes which included quitting planes, vegetarianism, bicycling, freeganism, and composting. I found the term “freeganism” interesting since I had not heard of it before. I think it is good that the term allows people more flexibility in their diet while being environmentally considerate instead of having a strict label on themselves such as vegan or vegetarian and being limited. It is important that Peter Kalmus provides  actual actions examples that he took to reduce his carbon emissions versus just talking about ways he did them and provides facts to support his points. When he states that the average American diet emits about 3 metric tons of CO2 and that he has lowered his own carbon emissions lower than that by becoming vegetarian and is lower after adopting freeganism and growing his food. Seeing how much he was able to lower his carbon emissions even through small changes is encouraging for people to do their own part and make changes that are  within their reach. In “Collective Actions” it talks about possibilities to lower carbon emissions through a carbon fee and dividend(CFAD) and explains how that would work. After reading about the CFAD and hearing how it works and how it can be established in a way to not drag the economy, but instead boost it. Kalmus provides an example of how British Columbia has already established carbon tax which has reduced, so there is evidence of CFAD working. I think the carbon tax and dividend  would be effective here in the U.S if implemented correctly like explained by Kalmus.

I agree, Yunjany, that after reading both “Leaving Fossil Fuels” and “Collective Action” by Peter Kalmus I was hopeful for our future and our attempts to combat climate change. I appreciate when people discuss solutions to climate change as it brings hope and tells people what they can do to make a difference. I found Peter’s personal changes he discusses in “Leaving the Fossil Fuels”. His change in transportation and eating habits impressed me. I personally am not someone who is easily willing to change. Being the picky eater I am, it would be hard for me to change to a plant based diet. However, I do believe in reducing food waste and am willing to do what I can to make that change. For transportation, I prefer using public buses to get around. Unfortunately I can’t give up flying as this spring break I am flying to see my family on the East coast. 
   <br><br>

One thing I appreciate about Kalmus’s writing is that he provides a good amount of facts and statistics. This gives the reader a better understanding of climate change and shows its urgency. Peter Kalmus’s second piece, “Collective Action” also provides an interesting take on what we could do to reduce emissions. I liked Kalmus’s idea of a carbon fee and dividend, especially after what you mentioned, Yunjany, that it would actually boost the economy instead of hurting it. Providing the example of the CFAD in British Columbia was, I agree, a good way of showing it works. The US should be taxing carbon emissions or selling pollution permits to large carbon producers.



<br><hr>
I also felt a bit more optimistic than I normally do after most reading that we have had assigned for this course. I felt a bit more normal and less guilty knowing that Peter Kalmus had once been just as bad a contributor (and a bit bigger) of CO2 gas and other greenhouse gas emissions as me before making his huge switch to a more eco-conscious lifestyle. It makes the journey look more possible than it seems. 
   <br><br>
I especially enjoyed the "Leaving Fossil Fuel" chapter more than the other. There were more optimistic notes in this chapter that were truly encouraging to me. As a college student at UCSB who only lives three hours away, I never have to fly home for the holidays. The last time I had to fly was for a family emergency to Arizona. On the occasion that I do go home for the weekend, I take the train (which has student discounts) or I will rideshare. Rideshare is not only a very cheap alternative to having my own car here, but it also eliminates traffic when more people decide to carpool on the freeways. I have come to love the process of rideshares because of the willingness of people to carpool to a location close to their desired location. It can be the center of their town or the next neighboring town. Either way, I appreciate the collaborative movement of carpooling that has come with UCSB's Facebook Rideshare program.

What I really enjoyed about Kalmus’ reading is that he addresses different perspectives and looks at the climate crisis holistically. When we began to learn more about the largest contributors to our carbon footprint -- such as flying and animal agriculture -- I felt somewhat discouraged because of how common these practices are, and how deeply ingrained they are in American society. For example, while I have only flown twice in my lifetime, I plan to study abroad in the fall and I have always had a desire to join the Peace Corps and travel later in life. Even after the lecture on flying, I was surprised about how bad it is for the environment, but I didn’t change my mind about my desire to travel in the future. But what really moved me was Peter’s example of the woman who travels back and forth from Africa to help women safely deliver babies. He put it simply and unapologetically: you don’t have to go across the globe to fulfill your life’s purpose, you can start in your community. This definitely hit home, since I see people struggling to make ends meet or who don’t have health care in my very own community, who need help as well. As for animal agriculture, I became seriously motivated to decrease my meat consumption and try to transition into a vegetarian diet throughout the course of this class. However, I was still doubtful, not because I didn’t think I could do it but because I felt that it wouldn’t make much of a difference. Kalmus addressed this feeling as well, by recognizing that individual actions wouldn’t dramatically reduce emissions when our country continues to reward those who still heavily rely on fossil fuels. He instead points out how taking individual actions has increased his well being, his sense of community, and has helped him align with his values. Not only are these personal benefits enormous, but adopting climate-conscious lifestyle changes such as biking everywhere, eating a plant-based diet, composting, and clothes-lines will motivate Americans to transition away from fossil fuels. I think a huge misconception is that taking individual and/or collective action such as carbon fees or biking rather than driving will de-civilize society and reduce our quality of life. But as Kalmus points out, turning away from fossil fuels will not only be good for the planet but improve life as well. I personally really enjoyed this reading and I plan to read the rest of the chapters over the course of the year in my freetime.

I thought that this weeks reading was very useful. It was interesting to see just how helpful it is to calculate your climate footprint when you are attempting to lower it. To look at your life and find out what your biggest emitters are can be the most useful tool in decreasing them. If you are a climate scientist like Peter then you can do this yourself. However, there are several free online tools and apps that will do this for you nowadays making it easy for anyone to calculate their climate footprint!
   <br><br>

Peter calculated that his largest emissions came from flying, so he chose to stop flying altogether. I recently downloaded an app and found out that most of my emissions come from buying stuff. Because of this, I have tried to start buying things second hand instead of new and shop locally when I can instead of online. This has made me feel much better about what I buy, feel more connected to the makers of my items, and saved me money! I think that many people will find that they feel this way too when attempting to reduce their footprints.

   <br><br>

It was also important to learn that they are many options for reducing your climate footprint at every price range. For example, if you wanted to reduce your emissions from driving you could switch to an electric vehicle (the most expensive option), use public transportation, or bike (probably the cheapest option). It is important for people to know that they can live a sustainable life without breaking the bank and be happier for it!

I also found this weeks reading very useful. Peter mentioned that "finding alternatives ... has felt like a fun and engaging game" to him and I couldn't help but think about how although the alternatives he found were a little advanced and somewhat out of our reach we too have fun when thrifting and shopping local at our farmers markets. Peter mentioned that he stopped flying and instead began working from home and how he used vegetable oil to keep his car going and although these are very impressive life changes, not everyone has the privilege of being able to follow his footsteps. I did find the things he did respectable but I also found them unrealistic in some aspects. For instance not everyone can ride a bike everywhere or has the space to grow their own food. Although not everyone can do what he did in regards to composting their poop and changing their gas to vegetable oil, we can still make some impactful changes by doing other things like shopping local for our groceries, thrift shopping, walking to places, and unplugging things that aren't being used. 
   <br><br>

Peter mentioned that U.S. landfills emit 1300 kg CO2 per person every year! I believe that this number could decrease drastically if more people composted their food scraps. Not only would CO2 levels decrease but methane would also decrease. Methane is more potent than CO2. Just like cities provide households with trash cans and recycling bins they should also provide people with compost bins and sites that are in need of rich soil. Although we as individuals can make a change, I believe that it does take a greater group of people to make a significant impact. As a community we can reduce our greenhouse gas emission.

In Chapter 9 "Leaving Fossil Fuel", Kalmus has a section on "Waste" which highlights all the ways of cutting down his climate footprint by changing waste habits. This was particularly of interest to me as I work with the Isla Vista Compost Collective and have done their data analysis/reporting since last summer. Using the EPA's Waste Reduction Model (WARM) to estimate the amount of CO2e emissions saved, we have calculated that the program has prevented the release of 6.5 metric tons of CO2e in over 2 years. Kalmus highlighting this action in his book is super reassuring that our efforts as a team are going towards the right things. At the same time, the many other methods he shows puts the idea that it many different changes (big and small) in order to effectively minimize your own carbon footprint. It was also interesting to see how according to Kalmus' calculations, driving a car fueled by vegetable oil had the same effect as organic composting. Overall, Kalmus' detailed documentation of his own lifestyle changes is inspiring and having these numbers to place on different actions definitely helps me think about how important each one is.

I found this reading to be incredibly informative. As an individual who struggles with weighing the real impacts of my carbon-intensive behaviors and activities, it is very helpful to have the numbers broken down for me. Many of us want to be committed to the fight against climate change. But there are so many ways to have an impact, and such little time in our lives, it can be difficult to know which options are the most effective. For me personally, I realize that my biggest contributor to climate change comes from driving my car. Kalmus claims that, in the year 2010, between himself, his wife, and their sons, they drove their 45 mpg car about 15,000 miles. I average about 10,000 per year alone and my car gets about 19-26 mpg depending on how I drive it. That means I’m putting an extraordinary amount of carbon into the air because I am so attached to owning and driving my own vehicle. To limit this, I could eliminate short-drives such as from my house to the grocery store, about a mile away. However, because the public transportation system in Santa Barbara is so inefficient, it would not be practical for me to cut down on my driving by much.
   <br><br>

His discussion of electricity use was also particularly helpful. He claims that it would be impractical for his household to switch to an individualized renewable micro-grid, since they only consume a small amount of electricity as a household. I suspect that many households are like this, so it’s incredibly inefficient to expect individual households to revamp their energy systems. Rather, community choice energy aggregates can be an extremely effective way to collectively shift to clean energy. If we can take control of our energy infrastructures on a regional, city, and/or community scale, we can make it cheaper and more efficient to use renewable energy to power our homes instead of fossil fuels.

Different from other readings claiming facts, severe impact and solutions. This week’s reading focus on some other aspects of carbon emission like the discussion of people’s motivation to cut emission or the main contribution to the carbon emission. The author also shown his own emission profile in the reading and give it a discussion. This gave me a reference. What i find the most interesting and effective information to me is the part of motivation to cut emission as i used to have the same concern. In the chapter, it is said that some people consider personal effort to be useless as it make no difference, so most people don’t cut their emission. I used to under the same situation. Every time i am facing a difficulty of making a decision of transportation way or wether or not to eat more meat in this meal. I know the right decision and what should i do. But there’s another thought popped out in my mind immediately that my own contribution, like the reading said, is a drop in the ocean which means it won’t make any difference to the carbon emission and i don’t even know if others will take actions. This thought lead me to be not sure about if it is necessary for me to cut emission  with the expense of giving up comfy and even some my favorite stuff. I felt like i have no motivation to make me take action to cut emission. But after reading the passage, i found the three reasons shown useful and literally give me reason to cutting emission. As the reading told us, i need to find the interest in the life with less fossil fuel and enjoy living in this way. What’s more, living with less fossil fuel also means “ more connection with land, food, family, friends and community”. And it’s true that i will feel better when we are cutting emission as it is “aligning my actions with my principles”. Besides, instead of making no difference, my personal reduction can actually help shifting the culture indirectly and encourage others to follow the trend of cutting emission.

Yeah, I think too that the author did a great job in explaining how changing to the healthier lifestyle will not only affect our normal daily life but reduce the carbon emissions. Flight as he introduced is one of the sources that caused the most carbon emissions. If we would choose other ways like trains, it will be better. Like the author said changing one personal habit is like “water dropped in ocean”, which won’t cause any big effect. However, many of them can. When everyone cares about their carbon footprint, the world would change.

This is by far my favorite reading in this class. I like that it is not only full of a lot of facts and statistics, but also from the perspective of self and mindfulness. The author says: "I now realize that few people respond to facts. I also realize that I cannot respond meaningfully to difficult situations based on my intelligence alone. I also doubt that even the collective wisdom of our society It's enough that our best scientists and smartest decision makers work in the roles they portray. Ken's biggest suggestion to help us deal with the climate crisis is to vote for the best candidates for the environment It would be great if they just love the planet and want to make it better, but how can politicians really do that? Of course, they can ban hydraulic fracturing in California and force companies to reduce emissions But these seem to be small solutions to a big problem. With the development of many smart technologies such as smart houses, I believe that even considering environmental issues, a lot of waste will be eliminated, and users of this smart technology save money .

I share your opinion on the importance of self reflection. I really related to the portion of that quote  you used which said "I cannot respond meaningfully to difficult situations based on my intelligence alone." These last few weeks have been all about how to relay all the information we have learned to others. It has been about communication and strategies and connecting with out communities. It is so different from what I previously thought was The strategy to convincing people of your views. I personally respond Really well to facts. A full page of facts is enough to get me listening. But I understand now that not everyone thinks the same way I do. This class painted the issue as more three-dimensional than I previously thought. These comments revealed the different backgrounds and influences on people and how that effects their view on the Climate Crisis. I learned a lot about environmental injustice and on the myths perpetuated by the fossil fuel companies. My self-reflection has led me back to the importance of keeping an open mind and talking to people. "Being The Change" really outlined how the small choices you can make yourself adds up to massive change. In a quick change of topics, I enjoyed the chapter on leaving fossil fuels. I honestly thought it would be a lot more difficult for the world to adjust than this chapter (and class)implied it would be. But I think the real selling point of this chapter was the practical approach looking at the effects leaving fossil fuels behind would have on the world. It highlighted mitigating the climate crisis yes, but it also implied a cleaner and attainable future that world without fossil fuels would build.

When reading the two chapters from "Being the Change" there were parts that really made me sad for what the future holds. It was sad how Kalmus writes that he does not know what the future holds for his own children. This made me really sad because we simply do not know what the future holds. Will we all wake up and act or will we just continue to let this problem worsen like we have been for a while now? I felt that this type of emotion is good though because I feel that it scares people into beginning to take action. Everyone that lives on earth deserves to live here without having to deal with climate change, but it has gotten too bad for us to not act now. Kalmus shows that it is possible to do what he is suggesting because he was able to do it. He was once someone like us who emitted as much carbon into the atmosphere as they felt because they did not know the global impact of it or did not care. The reading gave me some hope because it shows that it is possible to reduce your carbon footprint, all you need to do is act on the knowledge that you are harming the planet by emitting CO2 into the atmosphere.  I feel that many many more people need to be educated on this issue just as we are and given solutions just as the ones mentioned throughout the entirety of the course. I enjoyed the reading because it comes from someone who is doing all that he is proposing. I do agree however that Kalmus' car that runs on food oil would be difficult for many to do, but there are other modes of transportation.

You said that our climate problem has gotten too bad for people to not do something about it and I totally agree. Peter and his family made lifestyle changes that we also have the choice to make. He didn’t do anything drastic, he just made small changes, like diet, transportation, taking care of waste, and even household chores. It’s not true that individual choices don’t make a difference, because if everyone thinks that it’s true, our CO2 emissions will stay the same and we will all suffer the consequences. I feel like this idea has been reiterated in this course so many times. Individual choices seem small, but they do matter. Kalmus shows that these lifestyle changes are possible. So yes, people should definitely make changes in the way they live their lives because climate change has gotten so bad that the future seems dark and uncertain.

I found this week's reading, along with the "Being the Change" documentary very inspiring! I admired that while he not only researched the climate and found ways to reduce emissions, he also practiced what he preached, and made the changes in his own life, showing that change is possible. As Peter discussed his total emissions, I started to reflect on my own emissions in my daily life. Admittedly, I do fly, drive, eat meat, shop, and use a dryer. Before this class, I would have thought I was doing all I could for the climate crisis, while that is very obviously not the case. As Peter details his changes, and even reflects that he likes his new life better than his old (Like biking instead of driving), it made me more motivated to start to change my habits.  If saving the planet can truly make my life better and I can help the planet, why wouldn't I do it?

   <br><br>

While not all of us can drive a vegetable oil-powered car, I think a lot of the changes he implemented are not much to ask, and it helps a lot that he detailed how he calculated these emissions so that a reader can measure their emissions as well. The reading is accessible, easy to understand, and effectively communicated, which follows every climate activist rule shown in the reading on communication. I just wish I had known about these things sooner, so I could have stopped emitting so much CO2 earlier. I am definitely going to try to emit less, and I honestly would like to know more about freeganism... (is it like dumpster diving? I still don't quite understand).  
   <br><br>


I do like that Peter made all of these changes himself. As he states in the readings, many climate activists do not practice what they preach and fly to conventions all over the world to speak and advocate for climate activism. I really have no idea how they fly so much with a clean conscience. But with Peter's lifestyle changes, he shows that anyone can help the climate by changing their lifestyles, no matter your living situation. Anyone can try to bike more, cut out meat, start to garden! With the way politicians often stall in helping the climate, I think activism has to start at home. But, I do appreciate that he discusses policy as well, as it shows that saving the environment can be beneficial to the people as well as the Earth. Both sides of the argument are so important, as people need to vote for politicians that will advocate for policies like the Green New Deal, in order to see any changes, and they need to know that their money will be well spent.  I really do just think the information needs to be spread. :)

I agree with a lot of what you commented on. To begin with, having my family live 18 hours away by flight (Dubai), I am a frequent flyer and through these last couple of weeks, I have felt extremely ashamed of that fact. It made me feel that although I could eat less meat, spend less on clothes or use more public transport, everything aforementioned would be mitigated by the fact that I frequently flew via airplane. However, as you mentioned, through the readings it made me realize that just because I did a lot of things which acted as a great detriment to the environment, doing things that supported the environment still could go a very long way. It made me feel all the more motivated to carry on doing what I can to help. Yes, I am still going to fly back home however, that's not within my control. Until there's a viable sustainable alternative to flying, there's nothing more I can do. As the reading mentioned, that doesn't mean to say that I should add on to the detriment, but rather accept the detriment I am contributing towards and work adjusting small things in my life to aid the environment. In terms of the reading, Kalmus intelligently talks about how he was able to change his life and provided readers with step-by-step methodology of how he did it. This shows readers how achievable everything is and not it is very much within our reach to prompt sustainable changes.

<br><hr>
I agree!  I really liked that Peter implemented and acted upon the things that he researched, and I think that it makes these things seem more tangible for people when they read it.  I also fly, drive, and (occasionally) eat meat, but I think that there are many other ways for us (especially living in isla vista) to reduce our carbon footprint.  Though I use my car to go home or surf on the weekends, during the week my bike is my main form of transportation, and I think it is the same for most other students as well.  I also don't think that many college students can afford or even have the resources to own a veggie oil powered car, but I appreciated that he included his calculations because it makes it super easy for us to attempt to calculate ours as well.  I also found the reading to be easy to read and digest which was nice because a lot of texts about the climate crisis can be super dense and hard to take information from.  I think Peter's lifestyle is very inspiring!  He has inspired me and I think that he has been pretty successful in inspiring most of the students in class and encouraging simple but impactful lifestyle changes.  I also like that he discusses policies and politics to help get students more involved and find our voice.   Education is key!

In the chapter, “Leaving Fossil Fuel” he describes his own journey of changing his lifestyle. He describes the transition and the impact that it has made. How him changing his lifestyle has made him not only help decrease his carbon footprint but he is happier. He made it seem easy when it is actually harder. However, in the second chapter, “Collective Action” he provides examples of ways that the reader can take action and also make a change. Just by reading these two chapters I can see why he titled the book, “Being a Change” as he is being the change and persuading others to also be.

Although Ken has came up with an idea that we should take less airplanes many times before, it does enhance my agreement with this proposal after reading "Being the Change". Knowing about many advantages of choosing not to take airplanes, like emitting less CO2 which is widely known,  having more time to company families, I begin to think about truly take actions as this instruction. And those contents related to carbon fee persuasive me to support this proposal. I think that it is better than carbon tax as the author mentioned and we should advocate people surrounding us to support that.

I enjoyed Peter's book much more than the film. Chapter 9 was interesting because he showed how his greenhouse emissions decreased tenfold from 2010 to 2014. I feel like if people could see how much CO2 they were emitting it would be easier for them to change their habits. Most of us are ignorant at how much CO2 is generated by our activities just like how Peter was surprised at how flying was so bad for the environment. There are two sections that show how to estimate your emissions and the climate impact of everyday actions. I liked being able to see how much I was emitting because it allows me to make a plan at how to reduce them. It was also interesting how much CO2 is generated by doing laundry and showering. It's a shame how our waste generates more CO2 than the average Bangladeshi. We should be using this waste as biofuel or composting it. We should make food more available to people so it won't get thrown in landfills. 
   <br><br>

Chapter 14 discussed ways on how we can work together to stop climate change. He mainly talks about the carbon fee and dividend. From what I understand, people will pay a fee for the amount of CO2 they emit and be paid a dividend from those fees. It definitely seems like a good idea and will reduce fossil fuels and pressure people to switch to renewable energy. However, I feel like the biggest thing we must do is just use less energy.  If we do this, it will be quicker to reach net-zero emissions. Overall, I feel like a carbon fee and dividend should be talked about more since I feel like most people would agree to it since people will be being paid dividends without the burden of extra taxes. Sure, nobody likes to pay fees but this will help make renewable energy cheaper and lower emissions.

I am delighted to read the original work, the book version Being the Change by Peter Kalmus, after watching the film last week, because the film actually ignited my interest towards learning more of the scientist’s suburban life. In the two chapters specifically chosen to focus on the separation with fossil fuels and strength of collective actions, I got both my previous knowledge reinforced and new detailed information supplied. As in chapter 9, Kalmus stated “My five most effective actions were quitting planes, vegetarianism, bicycling, freeganism, and composting.” Then, he moved on introducing the aspects respectively--their weighted contribution to Greenhouse Gas emission, their reason for urgently being cut down, and the relative impacts on climate crisis. I don’t know the specific time the book was finished but I am surprised at Kalmus’ early action in his time, cuz it’s recently that the name has been changed from “global warming” and “climate change” to “climate crisis”, but he started all his personal actions at that early stage, when changing lightbulb is still an comparable option. Also, the part at the bottom of chapter 9, which is about flying and the quest for sustainability, especially caught my attention. I’ve learned a lot through Ken’s video about flying, but actually I long cannot figure out why I feel unsensible to this No.1 quickest emitter.  Here, in Peter’s work, I found a relatable feeling due to the fact that we ordinary ppl don’t quantify daily carbon emission as he did. Furthermore, his structure of this paragraph is so logical that it even brought up the common seem-to-be-true question regarding being on board: without me, the plane still flies. I really like his explanation for this part cuz this is my unsolved question for so long and through his interpretation, the problem seemed clearer and more scientific, strongly convincing myself to avoid flying.

Being the Change certainly teaches us on how to be the change to our lives and the world. We might not think that we are the pivot point of the climate crisis, but there are many people who thinks just like us. These people want to make a change, they know what they need to do, and they have the ability to do it. The only thing impeding them from action is the fear of such “trivial” acts having no effects, but I think that we should just ditch the second thoughts and directly follow our gut, if we want to make a change, there are no second thoughts, the only thought we should have is: I want to change the world, I CAN change the world.

I found Peter Kalmus’ three points on why he reduces very enlightening. The first reason he said was because he enjoys living with less fossil fuels. He likes growing food and biking. This is a very good mindset to have because it is one which allows you to reduce without it feeling like a chore. The second reason is similar to the first in that reducing aligns with his principles. He enjoys nature and the community; actively burning fossil fuels with the knowledge that it is harmful does not sit well with him. Being able to be self-aware of the carbon footprint you give off and sticking to your morals is very impressive. Many people, like he said, would just shrug it off because they figure they are only a tiny, insignificant part of the whole carbon emissions. His third point was that he believes personal reduction does help, just indirectly. He spoke about how some people he has come across have started making some lifestyle changes to reduce as well. This can have a domino effect and hopefully one day the main culture will be one of using less fossil fuels.

I personally really enjoyed the reading that you presented to us this week. Being based off of the video that we already watched from Kalmus, it was good just based off that fact. I considerably enjoyed the reading more than the movie because it cuts out some of the fillers and breaks from the issues at hand that the movie inserts. The reading shows how Kalmus really knows what he talking about, as a Climate Scientist. He is able to reach a more educated audience with the reading, with this rendition not being visual. My favorite parts are how he mention that those who are "Being the Change" at the moment are where we need to be as a society and that they are already ahead of us who aren't there in that aspect. His ideas are well intended, but at times seem a bit unrealistic for the average American. But honestly maybe these this will be possible if we enact the culture changes that need to occur.

This reading, did give me hope because Peter Kalmus talks about how I could personally make a change and not give me a big list of things of things that are impossible for a college student. The reading was very positive and gives us not only the changes we could make but how big of a difference it would make in the world. Also how Ken mentioned, Kalmus made sure he pointed out the little things and I was very proud of myself when I heard that hang drying your clothes saves so much energy, I never thought of that before I always just hang dry my clothes because it makes them last longer. With all the examples that were given of the little things that emit CO2, it really made me start to think about all the fancy technological things that are inside my home that are consistently plugged in. I will be more conscious to unplug things now that I understand the consequences. I think that since Peter Kalmus backs up all his statements with cold hard facts that it makes his argument much more valuable to the reader.

I agree, I really love how Kalmus shared all of his calculations with us in the two chapters assigned.  It insane to fathom that each American buys such a massive amount of goods each year, and that virutally every microscopic step that goes into that production process is sending high concentrations of carbon billowing into the air.  I sort of take it in this way, what Kalmus means about market failure.  Favoring all the economic benefits that come with our decisions and refusing to come to terms with the massively destructive consequences, whether they were known or unknown.  I  really liked how Kalmus demonstrated all of his pie charts and calculations to show us in perspective how our market actions take a huge toll on our personal life and more importantly the quality of life of others.  His excerpts were excellent reminders to be active decision makers in the economy and support practices that are valuable and life sustaining, and begin to boycott those that are decreasing the overall global quality of life.  Kalmus put all the information i needed to know in a few concise chapters and I thought that was awesome.


<br><hr>
I definitely agree, this list feels much more doable and tailored to individual action than project drawdown's. Especially as a college student, I feel like a lot of the advice offered by most environmentalists focuses on homeowners and people who buy their own food rather than go to dining commons, and so I didn't know exactly how to go about reducing my footprint. Peter Kalmus, however, offers advice on how each one of us can make a difference and I admire that. I also like how he showed his calculations and proved the efficacy of each action taken.
   <br><br>


I too felt very optimistic while reading this, because so often our attention is drawn to the problems of the world, particularly the environment, and not how to fix them. Kalmus actually offers real, personalized solutions that are achievable. My only issue with the individual responsibility approach is that not everyone is willing to do this to save the planet. I asked how he expected the average American to break from their culture for the planet during a video chat in ENG 22. His response was essentially this:

   <br><br>

I don't expect the average American to make these changes, at least not right away. I expect you, the people who care about the environment, to make these changes, and lead others who may be sympathetic by example. I expect then this to be enough support to use legal framework and government to come up with solutions that everyone must comply with.

   <br><br>

For me this answer was very satisfactory, and now leading by example is the primary goal of my behavior towards the environment.

I enjoyed this reading as it offers solutions to the climate crisis as tested and proven effective through participation and putting into action.  This was done by a climate scientist, Peter Kalamus, so he was able to really study and determine what impacts each of his actions made.  I really liked how he simply told the story of what he did in the changes that he made, and then he used science to back up his personal actions and how they decrease his carbon footprint and climate impact.
    <br><br>

Through “Being the Change,” Peter Kalamus was able to provide the reader with a Project Drawdown type of big picture of what to do and the impacts each change made, while only offering personal action changes that one is able to implement in their lives.  It does a great job at laying out all the positive impacts one can make if they become critical of how they live their life and look deeply into what they really need and what is simply extra.  I think that if everyone did this, then the world would be much better off.  People would start finding meaning in what really matters rather than all the things that they can buy to take up space.  Only owning things of deep meaning and having things one truly needs will not only allow people to become happier and find meaning in what they are doing, but also decrease their carbon footprint and the amount of emissions they have.  This is clearly seen with Peter Kalamus and his life, along with his family’s life.  They are truly an inspiration, and I believe that everyone should strive to make life changes as they have.  It does not have to be as major as them, but everyone should try and be critical of how they are currently living their lives, in order to discover what changes they can make to better our current situation in the climate crisis.  It could be as small as being a climatarian, just making little choices when it comes to meat consumption or purchasing local and seasonal foods.  Every little action and change counts, and it is important that we do our part in improving the situation.

After reading two chapters of "Being the Change" by Peter Kalmus, I have a deeper understanding of how to take personal actions to reduce CO2 emissions. He provides specific data about how exactly one's action can influence the climate. To be honest, I don't have a clear idea about how my change in lifestyle can save the Earth. Besides, I used to hold the idea that personal actions only play a small role than political movements in climate change. Sometimes I even doubt the possibility that whether the things I do have an impact on this huge planet. Peter Kalmus gives me the confidence to continue my actions, such as walking or taking the bus instead of driving. For example, in the book "Being the Change", Peter Kalmus mentions that "vegetarian in 2012 reduced greenhouse emissions by about 1500 kilograms of CO2, which surprises me because I never expect that being a vegetarian can lead to such huge difference. Though I can't switch my eating habits in a short period of time, I can intentionally cut down the amount of meat I ear, especially the beef. Additionally, Kalmus provides many methods to protect our Earth. For students like me, who live in dorms and can't change fixed infrastructures, such as using solar energy to provide electricity and live in a smaller house, Kalmus gives other practical suggestions. For instance, buy fewer clothes and don't waste water resources. Thus, don't complain that there is no way to change because changing any aspect of our lifestyle can make a difference.

I understand where you are coming from, in the big scope of things our contribution seems insignificant; we feel belittled because although we are trying to be the change, our actions may come off as irrelevant or perhaps minuscule due to the continuation of societies destructive habits. However, two steps forwards and one backward is still change and when relating that change to the climate crisis it is especially significant. It is important for a number of reasons, first of all, you're being more conscious and aware of your actions and the consequences it will have on the planet, second, the act of changing your old habits may bring you happiness because you are being more mindful, and finally, you are setting an example for your peers and family members that might ask you about your decision thereby leading to an open conversation about your motive that might intrigue them to pursue a similar path as you. Therefore, I completely agree with your last statement about a difference no matter its degree is still a positive one.

I learned a lot from the “Collective Action” chapter. I had previously heard about the carbon tax before, but I did not know much about it. From the reading I also learned about the carbon fee and cap-and-trade. I actually had not really heard much about the carbon fee before, but after learning about it I think it is a great idea. For most people, a carbon fee would be pretty much only beneficial. Not only would you be able to take part in saving the Earth, but you could also earn money from doing it. Peter provided a great number of reasons that the carbon fee works. Some of the things that he talked about were that they lower emissions, there are economic benefits, and it would help redistribute the wealth. Some important things that he touched on are that we need to get money out of politics and really shift the whole social system to focus on sustainability and connection over consumption and individualism.

I also took a lot away from the "Collective Action" chapter of Kalmus's work. I honestly did not understand much about carbon taxes or carbon fees before this class, but it honestly is one of the best solutions for large, collective change. And not only would this save our planet, but like you said it could redistribute wealth and began an era of economic prosperity. Of course, personal actions are incredibly important too, but at this point in the climate crisis strong political changes are key, and a carbon fee is the best example of this.


<br><hr>
I also found the chapter on "Collective Action" to be very interesting and eye-opening. I had heard about cap and trade and carbon taxes, but I found it very interesting to read about these ideas from a climate scientists point of view. I think that Peter's opinion and perspective on a carbon fee makes great sense and would not only benefit the planet (although this is only a step in the right direction, not the final solution) it seems like it would also benefit people. A carbon fee would seek investments in carbon-free alternatives and ensure a higher price of carbon for the future. It would also help to redistribute the wealth as you mentioned and put the money back into the hands of the average citizen. 
   <br><br>

Another part of this chapter that I found interesting is how we are going to make conservatives realize that this fee aligns with their general beliefs more than they think. I was surprised to learn that even some big oil companies agree that a carbon fee is a step in the right direction and how they would like more guidance from the government on how they should be shifting their business models. 
   <br><br>

The most important part of this chapter that I found was the part on getting money out of politics. I don't think that the government and politicians will truly be able to make decisions for American citizens with their best interests in mind if they are being controlled by large corporations who can sway their decisions with money. As Kalmus stated, this is a runaway cycle, if big companies use their money to manipulate the politicians/government officials to benefit them, this in turn will give them more money and power to continue doing this.

I think that in times where we feel really hopeless about the climate crisis because we are not in the government or agencies that have the power to actually change policies, it really is important to remember how much we can do at an individual level. Even if these individual changes feel small scale and insignificant, they can actually inspire others to make changes and incite a chain reaction. Regular people coming together is what the climate crisis movement needs to push for the people in places of power to change policies on a larger scale. 
   <br><br>

I also feel that the way Peter Kalmus went about this book is really effective. It is very fact-based and is not meant to take the audience on a guilt trip for not doing enough, but rather to explain why he has made these changes and what they do in terms of reducing carbon emissions and being more sustainable. As other students have noted, some people are already doing these things like using a clothesline or not driving often because they do not have the resources to buy dryers or their own cars. I do not think that Peter is saying that it is good that some people do not have access to these things; he is simply telling the people who are privileged enough to have these that they are not necessities and there are more environmentally friendly alternatives.

I agree that it is really important to think about what you CAN do, even when so many things are working against us. So I think while waiting for the government to listen to our votes, we can cut back on meat, cut back on air travel, and cut back on driving. I think being environmentally aware of yourself and the way you are living is equally as important as going out and voting for change.

I enjoyed both last weeks film and this weeks reading on Peter Klamus. The first chapter where he calculated his individual emissions was interesting to see. I liked how he included his calculations and the different ways he was able to display his data. A thought that popped up in my head is if someone is willing to develop an app that tracks your individual carbon emissions and how you can reduce it in some areas. I think this would be beneficial to people not familiar with science as they wouldn't have to do the calculations by themselves they can enter it into an app and it takes care of the rest.

Being the Change was an insightful reading, filled with useful and commonplace suggestions to cut carbon emissions in the lives of everyday people. While the film we watched last week entitled the same name was thought-provoking, it did lack in the field of relatability or rationality. I enjoyed this reading far more because it gave step by step instructions and suggestions backed by science that could more easily be reproduced on a global scale. 

   <br><br>

I specifically enjoyed the section of ‘Leaving Fossil Fuel’ where Kalmus practices vulnerability and honesty in terms of this transition’s effect on his mental health. He notes that he is far happier living by low energy standards. And even more, it saves him measurable portions of money. I think this blurp in the chapter was important because when people think about shifting to a more environmental lifestyle, words like ‘uncomfortable’ or ‘sacrifice’ might come to their minds. In terms of my own life, sometimes I think shifting my everyday habits to reflect environmentally friendly measures would make me unfulfilled. But this is a common mistake that is false! By living with less, one is actually gaining so, so much more for themselves and the future of humanity. People, especially those with the privilege to be able to shift their lifestyle, must comprehend that these decisions will only bring positive repercussions. This class has really taught me that it may seem like one has to give up so much, but in reality I think the new things we would receive with this cultural shift are so much more meaningful.

I had very similar sentiments regarding this week's reading. I enjoyed the suggestions that were provided and felt that they were much more realistic ideas that people would actually be willing and able to act on. I also agreed with the part about the changes Kalmus made having a positive effect on his mental health. I think people nowadays are so obsessed with achieving their goals and living a certain lifestyle, that they forget to take care of themselves. I really believe that making certain changes in one's life can drastically improve your well-being and make you a happier person.

As I read "Being the Change" by Peter Kalmus, I felt inspired to take more action towards climate change. The way that he quantifies all of his actions presents statistics that truly supports his claims. The numbers, although daunting, provides a feasible way to actually convey how much carbon he was emitting and proves that he isn't just "talking the talk." The amount of effort and attention to detail that Peter puts into this book is impressive. If I had to calculate every action's net carbon footprint, it would take me weeks, maybe even months. I appreciate that Peter did this so that we can actually see the numbers that correlate with different everyday actions. 

   <br><br>

This book helps people to see that going green doesn't always mean becoming vegan. In Peter's case, the biggest impact he could make on reducing his carbon footprint was giving up airplane flights. Many would not think to give this up because flying is an elitist form of "success." Wealthy people love going on flights and posting a photo of their new passport stamp or their plane taking off on their Instagram or Snapchat. Over the summer, as I checked my social media, I was seeing at least one person taking a flight every day. It's ridiculous that only 1/20 of the human population have even stepped foot on a plane. As Peter conveys, flying is a privilege that we simply do not need. I am going to encourage my family members and friends of the harms of flying to try to sway them to take longer modes of transportation, such as trains or buses.

I agree with your comment. Peter writes about his actions in such an efficient way that makes the reader more inspired to make a change compared to just laying down daunting facts. Most people understand that we are in a climate crisis and not everyone gets just how serious it may be but if an author just repeats what the reader already somewhat knows, their attention span won't last very long. The best way to try and get people to make a change in their actions, is to lead by example and that is just what Peter is doing. He is showing the reader exactly what contributes to a high carbon footprint which is important for people to understand. Then he proceeds to give examples on what exactly he does to cut down his emissions and provides the reader many different alternatives. For example, if Peter had somewhere he needed to be that was under 10 miles, he would ride his bike. This is a great way to not only help the environment, but also a perfect way to get your exercise in for the day! Personally, this article inspired me to rethink some of my unhealthy environmental choices. For one, I chose to find a carpool ride home for spring break instead of flying like I normally would. It may not make a big difference right now, but after more and more people make that same decision as me, there could be one less flight a day.




<br><hr>
I agree with the importance and helpful nature of this reading specifically in terms of the numbers that Peter provided to back up his claims. I find that when you can understand the statistical impact of an action it adds weight and understanding to what you are doing and makes you think twice about whether it really is worth it. An example of such a statistic that Peter brought up in the reading was a statistic about how manufacturing new stuff which includes cars, clothes, computers and furniture emits greenhouse gases. Peter gave the figure that for each dollar spent on new stuff, one is roughly emitting 0.5 kg CO2 emissions which includes manufacturing, shipping and other parts of the process. With the average US person spends a little over $6,000 per year on new stuff, translating to an average of emissions of about 3,000 kg CO2 emissions per year I cannot ignore the consequences of the actions to spend endlessly. Whenever I make a purchase in the future, this statistic will weigh in my mind and I will be better able to make a judgement about whether it is worth it to buy a product and emit however much CO2 emissions correlate to the product I buy. Another interesting part of the reading was when Peter addresses the best way to address climate change and the market failure we currently have as he suggests the two main solutions that are debated are a carbon fee and dividend or a cap-and-trade system. As an economics major, we have just recently went over both of these options as potential solutions to a way for the government to help make sure that the negative externalities that firms extend on society are internalized in some way that holds them responsible and makes them pay for their emissions. Overall, I thought the reading was informative and convincing as it led me to be able to better understand the importance of taking individual action and realize the weight of my own actions.

Before this reading, I had no clue that even machines such as dryers emitted as much as 0.5 metric tons of Carbon Dioxide in a single year. Knowing that our carbon allotment is 2 metric tons per year, it's scary to think about switching to a lifestyle where using your dryer already uses up 25 percent of that space. However, the way Kalmus describes his way of living as a sustainable climate change scientist is amazing and truly shows that an alternative lifestyle is possible. His arguments make a lot of sense and go over what we already have discussed in previous lectures: flying, cars, and of course diet are all huge factors that contribute to our global emissions. He also goes over the importance of composting which I thought was great because it was not stressed enough in class. I think that out of all the options, composting is by far the easiest and least time-consuming solution to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This is because organic waste in landfills decomposes and releases methane into the atmosphere. Like we learned in class, methane is 34 times more potent than Carbon Dioxide in trapping heat and is, therefore, a significant contribution to mitigating the climate crisis.

   <br><br>

I think what is great about Kalmus' book is that it is an honest reflection on someone attempting to live a more sustainable lifestyle. I feel like it is very hard to believe some statistics about climate change. Most of the time we have no clue where those statistics come from or are measured and are therefore deemed unreliable. However, Kalmus literally details how he changed his life step-by-step with acute observations and experiments making it hard for anyone to refute his achievements. Moreover, his actions demonstrate that anyone with the right mindset can achieve a fulfilling life all the while aiding in solving the climate crisis. Even if we were to implement one of the most effective solutions Kalmus' portrays, I believe the consequences of global warming would be drastically reduced. For instance, if we switched to a vegan diet, we would be preventing 2.5 metric tons of released Carbon Dioxide per person per year.

Like you, I was baffled by the fact that a dryer emits 25% of our ideal emissions for the entire year - that’s crazy. I think that fact in itself highlights the need to communicate climate change and individual actions that can be made. Simply switching to using a clothesline rather than a dryer is not some life-altering sacrifice, and I honestly believe that most Americans could realistically make the change if they just knew about the impact it has. Peter Kalmus was right in highlighting more prevalent issues such as flying, driving, and eating meat, but he was also right in emphasizing the climate impact of little things that we don’t even think twice about, such as light bulbs, dryers, etc. 
   <br><br>
I completely agree with you that what made Peter Kalmus’ book great was that it was an “honest reflection”. He admitted that even after all of the changes he’s made, he was still emitting more than the average person in Bangladesh. However, his actions highlight that with the right mindset, almost anyone can significantly reduce their emissions while still living a happy and fulfilling life, and this message is just as important. As helpful and informative as reading Project Drawdown was, it was really nice to hear about individual actions we can make almost immediately. We can reduce our emissions by a huge amount by simply not using a dryer, buying less new stuff, using more public transportation, etc. - and none of these are huge sacrifices. Kalmus also emphasized the need for climate activism, a big part of which is a carbon tax or fee. It surprised me how much overlap there is between this class and Econ 1. We just talked about how when there is a negative externality (which there clearly is) the most effective way to make the market efficient and not have overproduction is through a tax, which is exactly what Kalmus suggests.

I was also surprised to hear how much carbon dioxide dryers emit per year... It's interesting to hear that you also thought Peter's lifestyle as a scientist and as an environmentalist was interesting a completely possible! I feel like reading about Peter's life gives us students the opportunity to see what Ken has been talking about this whole time actually put into action. It's one thing to just talk about what we need to do to save our planet and/or make excuses for why we can't live sustainable in our lives, but it's another thing to actually see how someone is able to cut their carbon dioxide emissions down to 1/10 of an average American. For me, Peter's life serves as a perfect example of how it's 100% possible to cut down our CO2 without having to cut down on all of the riches of life that makes us happy. I mean, after watching "Happy" I noticed that happiness never comes from materialistic things like nice cars or a big house so it wouldn't take away our well being of life by living more sustainable lives.

I too appreciated Kalmus’ honest reflection about being more environmentally conscious; he reflected his experiences as a human… not a scientist. Although it did help me to have his science background; his graphs and wording at times made it feel educational but not too much for a non-science person to not understand. 
   <br><br>


One specific quote stuck with me the most, “Photons interacting with the atmosphere don’t respond to our acts of kindness; they only respond to our acts of greenhouse gas emission”. There was something about this line that really made me ponder life. We as a society can do acts of kindness like in the documentary Happy when the French man volunteered at the place where people spent their last days dying.  However, these acts of kindness (while I am not saying people should stop doing these things) do not help the fate of our planet. Just like purchasing a carbon tax will only justify flying for the 1% of people who do feel guilty. As Kalamus said, carbon taxes do not work. What works is choosing not to flym, and if enough people do that, one less plane will fly. 
   <br><br>


One thing I still can’t get over is his car that runs on vegetable oil. Burning plant oil doesn’t increase the net CO2 in the atmosphere. “The plants capture CO2 from the atmosphere to make the oil, and burning the oil releases that same CO2 back into the atmosphere for no net gain”. I see him driving on that stuff and think, well if it works, why aren’t more people and companies doing this? And then I remind myself, the fracking industry is basically controlling the world. Then again, Peter also said that biking was the best way to get around. So once again, fighting for better bike lanes and public transportation. 
   <br><br>


Another aspect of this reading I appreciated was the portion where an individual, should they choose, can estimate their own emissions as well as seeing the climate impact of everyday actions. Peter shows how to act on environmental daily tasks and the results of them. For this reason, the entire process seemed a little less intimidating

Unlike the Project Drawdown, which lists many collective goals involved cultural, agricultural, and industrial reform, the book Being The Change qualitatively breaks down the effort which each of us individual needs to take to transition into a better lifestyle. 
     <br><br>
 There are many interesting points about carbon emission that he brought up in the chapters. One of which is about waste, whether it is about the food waste, or residential waste, or electricity waste. Just by simply not wasting anything can cut down the carbon emission by a significant amount. I am guilty of wasting many things myself. Sometimes I felt it is not a big deal to consume and waste because my family can afford it, but we ourselves can’t afford it, there is so much hidden cost within every purchase, every transaction and everything we tossed away, and we have been only evaluating the cost of something by how much money I need to acquire it. However I am somewhat glad to see that how much I can reduce my carbon footprint just by not wasting, as it brings minimal impact to anyone’s daily life. 
    <br><br>
  In the chapters he also brings up the arguments against such a personal change. The example of the nurse who flies to Africa to assist childbirths resonates with my experience, not in a sense of saving people (of course), but in a sense that as an international student, flying back and forth is seemingly justified. But he is right, if you really care about the people, live with them; if I come here for academic excellency and opportunities, I should stay here for as long as I can. This is a difficult pill to swallow for me because I need (or I should say “want”) to go back once a year to see my family, and this wouldn’t change any time soon. I tried really hard to think something that I can justify my action but I just couldn’t see anything wrong with this rebuttal (besides flying happens to be one of the worst ways you can worsen the climate crisis).
   <br><br>

   This chapter makes me rethink the importance of personal actions, and how we should start changing. We have been talking about how some changes require a strong political will to realize. But without personal actions like these, politicians won’t find grounds to implement these changes. And without evaluating your own carbon emission quantitatively, it is easy to dismiss some of the actions that seemingly minor but it can increase your carbon footprint significantly (just like Peter, who is surprised to see that flying was the primary source of carbon emission when he just started to quantify his carbon footprint).

Kalmus mentions that living a fossil free life is a nice way to live. It is more community based, and grounded. Bike riding is not only beneficial to cutting down emissions, but also fun. Growing a garden is good for you, good for the planet and gives you a feeling of accomplishment.
   <br><br>

“Finding alternatives [to fossil fuels] requires creativity” problem solving can be fun, other than a burden.
   <br><br>

Kalmus mentions that he started getting as much food as possible out of what people waste aka freeganism. I love this idea, and I am doing my best to do this as well. People in the US waste exorbinent amounts of very edible foods, and instead of spending money and causing global warming we can work on actually eating what is already there.
   <br><br>

He mentions that personal reduction, although may seem futile at times, can help a lot and have a ripple affect by changing the culture, and societal norms.
   <br><br>

The section on natural gas surprised me; the author gave statistics supporting why a society based on natural gas might actually be more harmful to the planet than one based on coal. Natural gas is seen as a transition to renewables, however after reading this piece it has become apparent that we should not necessarily use the transition, just work on switching as much as possible to renewables straight away.
   <br><br>

The fact that one US persons trash emits more than a person from Bangladesh is depressing. We are such a consumptive country, and we need a societal value change in order to shift away from such extreme consumption.
   <br><br>

Also, I have heard the argument that putting food waste in the trash is fine because still compost anyway, and was always skeptical about this, so it is good to have solid information critiquing this. 
   <br><br>

Another interesting point is that in buying industrial food, a large percent of the food waste and lack of composting occurs before we even see the food. The only way to combat this is to grow your own food, or know the practices of local farmers and selectively buy from them.

I am very happy to see Peter also had a book about how to be environmental friendly. I learned more about how to act greenly and what contributes to the climate crisis of the US every year in a whole picture. I do not have a car and I am sadly an international college student here, so the main green house gas out put is the flying. I really want to improve that but actually I can't for there is no other way for me to get here. However, when I do not own a car and do not waste my food, I will reduce my emission to below average of human, I believe. I will just try my best to do the work like Ken and Peter!



</p><hr>


<p>
This reading was interesting as it is Peter Klamus giving us an individual look into what we can do. I was not surprised to see that Ken and Peter have a similar perspective on how we can help lower our personal emissions. I think that it is very important to look at what he says as valuable, because climate change is serious. I think one of the most important things that people often misunderstand is the negative effects of flying. Flying is so bad for the environment because of the amount of gas released and it is only one percent of the elite who fly.  
   <br><br>
Another important thing is eating a vegetarian food, biking instead of driving, and compositing. It was very interesting that lights being left on is what 1.5 metric tons of carbon emissions comes from every year. I also was shocked to learn that 2900 kg of CO2 which is 3 metric tons comes from our food diet. All of these huge numbers and large emissions of CO2 is really scary. I worry for my generation and my future kids generations. I do not think that the climate crisis can make us happy because I really do not see a change happening. I hope that laws are passed, things are changed, and we all get to live another day.

Just like Ken said, I did question why he included Peter Kalmus twice when we had already watched his documentary, but after I got done reading the two chapters in “Being the Change” I realized why. Both chapters explained how anyone, no matter what status you held in society, could lower their greenhouse emissions. Although I’m not quite sure the options he gave for certain things work for some people. simply because they might not have the means to carry it out or are unable to do to a disability. Chapter 14 titled “Collective Action”, gave us actions that we could take, like making carbon fee’s a thing, or us younger people standing up together up against the “people in charge”. Aside from that it also broke down the reasons why things could or couldn’t work, making it more understandable for the average person. 
   <br><br>

The reading was really informative and I hope it helps people reflect on their own personal level of emissions and it makes them more conscious of what we each are doing to the world.

Like you, I was confused when I saw that our assignment for this week had Peter Kalmus again. But this week’s reading was really nice. I found it informative and helpful, since “Being the Change” gives the reader a ton of ideas in terms of actions that one can take to reduce their carbon footprint and impact on the environment. It’s another nice example of a more positive and kind of almost instructional type of reading in clear contrast with the dark and depressing readings, videos, and films from the first half of the course. Like you, this reading made me look at my own life and analyze it a little bit more, to see what actions I can take in my own personal life to reduce my carbon footprint. 
   <br><br>


In particular, you noted Chapter 14, “Collective Action” and the carbon tax proposal. We’ve talked about carbon taxes before in the course but even so this segment of the reading was my favorite. I’m a huge supporter of carbon taxes and I believe that they would be an important and big step in ramping up action in combating climate change. Although a carbon tax isn’t a type of personal action that I could take myself, it’s a great example of the kinds of major steps we could take if collectively people came together to support plans like this and have the government actually sign things like a carbon tax into law.

Something that was very significant in this reading is the fact that Peter Kalmus , isn’t trying to reduce his emissions solely because of the fact that he wants to keep his emissions out of the atmosphere. He sees that having this as the main source of motivation would be “like trying to save the world all by myself”. Instead, Kalmus gives us three other reasons for why he is reducing his carbon emissions and this in itself is something that everyone should look into. He says that by reducing his carbon emissions, he is able to grow closer to the people around him and the world that surrounds him. Kalmus is also avoiding the feeling of guilt and regret associated with knowingly harming the planet with burning the fossil fuels and that if he slowly changes, he believes that others will follow eventually. Another thing that is very significant is the analogy he makes for doing acts of kindness in which we don’t expect anything in return. When we do something nice and don’t expect anything in return, it’s a good feeling and this is similar to our environment. “Photons interacting with the atmosphere don’t respond to our acts of kindness; they only respond to our acts of greenhouse gas emission”. This goes to show that we should look past getting something out of it and try to prevent our world from getting destroyed, but in reality this is the thing that we are getting out of it, the fact that we will still be able to live on the earth as we do now. I really like the structure of the reading because I am easily able to understand the significance of all the decisions that we make and the fact that the choices we make now have an impact on the later. I want to be able to make a change in my life not just for myself, but for the earth and the people around me. By offering alternatives to our carbon emissions, we are able to take into account what we can personally do to help the earth. We need to be able to look back on our emissions and see that we have done something to reduce it and that we can actually make a difference.

In the reading, Peter Kalmus mentions various solutions to reducing our emissions that we have already discussed in the class such as ramp down on flying, becoming vegetarian, start growing your own food, obtain a lot of your food from the waste stream (freeganism), composting a lot, and have biking be your primary mode of transportation. However, it was refreshing to see Kalmus give reasons to reduce that are aside from the purpose of fighting the climate crisis. One of these reasons involved him personally enjoying life with less fossil fuels because less fossil fuel usage means more connection with the land, food, family, and community. While the others may apply to even more people, which are how moving away from fossil fuels allows you to align your actions with your principles (avoid the guilt feeling), and personal reductions helps indirectly shifting the culture. The “Leaving Fossil Fuel” chapter did a great job at explaining to the readers that what you need to reduce depends on every person, because we all have different lifestyles, meaning different people may have different things in their life that emit intense amounts of greenhouse gas emissions. Other material in this course has discussed how bad airplanes are bad for global warming, however this text gave other reasons other than CO2 emissions. In addition to CO2 emissions, airplanes contribute to global warming via NOx emissions, contrails, and circus cloud formation. It is important to note that high icy clouds such as contrails and circus let the sun through but trap outgoing thermal radiation from the ground warming the planet. I was aware that the average American emitted a lot of CO2 emissions, but this is absolutely crazy, 1000kg CO2 per year from flying, 5000 kg CO2 per year from driving, and 2000 kg CO2 per year from residential natural gas. We are aware that typically the less meat and animal products one eats the less CO2 emissions they emit. For instance, a meat diet emits about 3000kg CO2 a year, a vegetarian diet emits about 1500 kg CO2 a year, while a vegan diet emits about 1000kg CO2 a year. Knowing that there are only 3% of Americans that are vegetarians, half of whom are vegan, makes me hopeful in terms of our carbon footprint, because this means we have improvement that can be made in this area and in my opinion this is an easy change that a lot of americans can make, thus we as a country can reduce our CO2 emissions by a lot. It is important to know that there are other things that go from the food ending up on your plate that add to the CO2 emissions other than what the food exactly is. For instance, growing , processing, packaging, and disturbing food produces greenhouse gases. Luckily, this text breaks down how each of these things produce greenhouse gases. CO2 from fuels, fertilizer production and land use changes such as deforestation, nitrous oxide (N2O) from fertilizer production and application, and methane from livestock. I really liked that this text was able to give people an alternative to solar panels that’s also a 100% renewable option that would cost only an additional $50 a year. As Americans, I swear, we are obsessed with shopping and constantly buying new things, it is as if we are hoarders. It feels as if we just buy stuff to buy stuff, maybe to look cooler as if we can afford things, as if it is some sort of status thing. Either way, each dollar spent on new stuff represents roughly .5 kg embodied CO2 emissions. The average US person spends a little over $6000 per year on new stuff, which is about 3000 kg CO2, do people even realize what they are doing when they click add to cart or they swipe that card at the register in a store. We are the consumers, we have the power in a perfectly competitive market, we have the power to decrease the demand, thus decreasing the production, and as a result decreasing the CO2 emissions. I really like that at the end of the “Leaving Fossil Fuel” chapter there was something that helped you estimate your own emissions because knowing your emissions across these categorizes, and tracking them over time will help you make informed decisions as you reduce your emissions.
     <br><br>
  As for “Collective Action,” this chapter noted things in the past the world has done collectively in an attempt to put an end to this climate crisis, while also giving collective solutions to what we still can implement to the world. A couple of our failed collective actions involve the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 and the Paris agreement in 2015. The 1997 Kyoto Protocol was made so that each country would reduce greenhouse gas emissions of 5% less than 1990 levels by 2012. Unfortunately, the US, China, and India never signed on and no one took the agreement seriously. I think no other countries took it seriously because they were simply following in the footsteps of the main emission contributing countries that lie before them. They must have thought, well if these countries who are mainly responsible aren’t doing it, why should I. This mentality and the lack of action from all the countries in the world backfired because global emissions were 60% higher than 1990 levels by 2013. As for the 2015 Paris Agreement, we were supposed to keep warming below 2 degrees celsius. Even though the US, China, and India signed this agreement, I think this agreement didn’t work because it was non-binding, thus people didn’t take it serious. Correct me if I’m wrong, but also the US dropped out of the Paris Agreement, leading a negative path for the rest of the world to follow. In my opinion, if we truly wanted the Paris Agreement to work, we should have had it binding. Despite our “attempts,” CO2 emissions have been growing exponentially at a rate of 2.2% per year. One of the solutions that we can still implement is a direct price on greenhouse gas emissions, which can mean a tax or a fee. The size of the fee can be gradually adjusted to meet an emissions goal, and the dividend should be sent to citizens as actual checks, not as a tax credit or a payroll adjustment. I like this idea of a carbon fee because there would be a reward for your actions in a way. Correct me if I am wrong, but the less carbon you would be using, the more dividend you would be rewarded at the end of the year. Basically it would give people two incentives, don’t spend as much on carbon, and get a financial reward for your actions. Another solution given in this chapter is a cap-and-trade, which is an alternative carbon pricing instrument in which total emissions are capped, polluters trade carbon permits (their right to emit a certain quantity of CO2) and the market sets the price, the cap is then lowered each year. However cap-and-trade do seem to have some problems such as that they are complicated and can be easily gamed, they’re expensive, traders will naturally speculate and exploit the market, and the dynamic of cap-and-trade perversely disincentivized emissions reductions. Fortunately, there seems to be a solution to some of these problems with cap-and-trade, and that is cap-and-auction, where carbon permits are directly auctioned to polluters. It’s important that we start investing in carbon free alternatives, we need to show the world that this is the future not the world’s destruction. This is something that needs to be changed now, I mean jeez we already have 200,000 people in the US who die prematurely each year from air pollution. This is not a problem we can procrastinate on solving, change is required now.

In the book, “Being the Change,” Peter Kalmus acknowledged that we have the power to live a much more sustainable and eco-friendly lifestyle. Individuals tend to abuse their privileges of living in such a world with advanced technologies. We were always told the the bigger the better but turns out that is not always the case. This weeks reading really allowed me to look at things in a different perspective. I began to look at my own carbon footprint and how exactly I am contributing to the climate crisis; whether that be negatively or positively. It turns out I was quite disappointed in myself because before this class, I honestly did not think how my action affected the climate or ways that I can help. As I read the book, Kalmus offered a list of small solutions that can be personally taken in order to help with the climate crisis that is quickly evolving. For example, avoid using a dryer, creating a garden to grow your own food, trading surpluses with neighbors, switching to renewable options, freeganism, limiting clothes shopping, avoid eating meat (especially beef) etc. Kalmus recognizes that each and every individual lives a completely different lifestyle and tends to offer solutions that can accommodate everyone. He even states that saving electricity can reduce plenty of Co2 emission. He also promotes less air travel, bicyclist, composting and being vegetarian. I find it insane to read that an average American’s diet can emit 3 metric tons.
   <br><br>
I love how he incorporates his funny and quirky personality into his advocacy. The fact that he operates a vegetable oil driven car named ’Maeby’ is hysterical because he never knows if the car will make it to its destination. I truly appreciate his book because it was much more academically informative than his documentary. All of the diagrams, images and examples have a great impact on the readers and how they perceive the statistics.  He provided instructions on how to calculate our own greenhouse gas emission and displayed the impact of different activities that individuals do on a daily basis. Peter Kalmus truly cares for the environment and takes responsibility for his own carbon footprint as well as being passionate about informing and helping others do the same.

I agree with you that Peter Kalmu’s book changes my perspective on personal actions. It is an individual action that allows collective work. If everyone makes efforts to move toward low-energy living, we can quickly cut global emissions. It’s time for us to change the social norm into a green environment, where people enjoy the local more and bike more. After reading, I begin to reflect on my carbon footprint. I love meat, milk, and dairy products, which are the food that harms the environment the most. Therefore, I decided to limit the amount of meat, milk, and dairy products intake every day. Even though it’s a little change, but I believe that if people each take some considerations into their daily life, there will be good results of our transformation. Then I will gradually change to a plant-based diet, but I wish the Americans could open up to more vegetable options. Besides, I will not waste food, and only take the amount that I’m able to finish. I’m happy that UCSB’s dining hall is taking action to reduce as much food waste as they could and create ‘green Monday.“ All these actions are good for the environment and will be encouraged by other institutions in the future. There are a lot more vegetables than lettuce, beans, spinach, and broccoli. I will also reconsider air travel since it is a devastating influence on the planet.

Peter Kalmus, who has come up before in lecture, breaks down how he went about bringing down his CO2 footprint. It is very clear upon reading Chapters nine and fourteen of his book "Being the Change" that Kalmus is a scientist. You can tell by the language he uses and how he choose to go about reducing his climate footprint by taking measurements and using a very analytical approach. Most of what is contained in chapter 9 are things that I had already learned in ENG 22 and ENG 23 however it was very cool to see Kalmus' personalized chart of how he personally put CO2 into the atmosphere, or how he used to I suppose. This made me wonder what my own personally chart of CO2 would look like and then got me thinking about how nice it would be to have such data at your fingertips. If everyone had easy access to this data without the hard number crunching, I think it would prove to be very rewarding as each individual could choose to cut down on perhaps their top 3 worse climate offending activities. I also found his idea of addressing a carbon tax as a fee rather than a tax and making that money go into combating climate change. Also I personally liked his thoughts on how the climate crisis can become a bipartisan movement, by making a carbon tax a fee and dividend system as this will encourage conservatives who personally believe in climate change but can't openly admit it without facing political scrutiny, to join the movement in a way that doesn't go against what they believe in terms of economics.

<p>
Kalmus explicitly outlined the changes that need to be implemented to help this crisis that we’re in and provides many statistics and numbers that he’s calculated to prove this. I think that his explicitly defined ideas are exactly what America and some other parts of the world need to understand. We’ve heard of the personal changes to be made before: changing our diets, avoiding air travel, voting, and more. The harsh truth that Ken quotes another student saying is that these changes are impossible for those of us who live on campus. I’m sure this is the case for many people who don’t have their own house. We don’t have yards to compost (though I know there are other ways here in Isla Vista), we don’t manage the electricity for our buildings, and we don’t control where our water goes (in the case that we wanted to use laundry water for gardening, etc.). These things are discouraging because we want to make more of an impact from our homes, but we can’t. These systems are already in place and since we’re only here for a few years, it would be difficult, but not impossible, to alter them to be more sustainable. 
   <br><br>


Regarding the first assigned chapter of the reading, I think that the carbon fee is a groundbreaking idea. It would be amazing to see those who didn’t contribute many emissions get a massive check at the end of the year. I think this is a GREAT incentive for people to find alternatives to their current and destructive ways of living. It would bring communities together as the majority will be encouraged to lower their personal emissions. Imagine the improvement of public transportation, local gardens, and more people biking and walking. I’m from a small town, and it would be so easy for my community back home to implement environmental changes because everyone is so close together. Like Kalmus stated, the carbon tax/fee is only the first step to incentivize populations to move towards a sustainable lifestyle. Continuity in activism and leading by example is needed now more than ever.

I agree that Kalmus’s explicitly defined ideas are exactly what America and some other parts of the world need to understand. I also agree with you that it is hard to make these changes for us students who live on this campus. Still, I do think that we have so many relationships in our life that it is important for us to educate those people on ways that they need to step up and make changes in their lives. I think that most importantly, we need to introduce our parents to these ideas. The things you mentioned like composting and managing electricity and water could be implemented by our parents so I think that we need to encourage them to do this. If everyone in our class encouraged their parents then change could really happen. 
   <br><br>
I also agree with you that a carbon fee is a groundbreaking idea. People that don’t buy a lot of products that are made through greenhouse gas emissions do deserve to end up having more money. This lifestyle change would be so influential on the reduction of climate change. Because as Americans, we usually need incentives to make these changes in our lives, it is important that we implement new legislation that would encourage people to make the changes necessary to ensure a healthy planet. Thanks for your response.

Peter Kalmus’s take on climate activism is one of the most refreshing ones we have examined in this class so far. He approaches the need to transform our planet through both the individual and systemic level and does both through the rational viewpoint of a scientist that can back up their facts with evidence and data. I found it interesting how meticulously he tracked his own emissions and the reductions that followed changes in his behavior. He used data collection methods that are used frequently in science. 
   <br><br>

Another really helpful component of his book is accessibility. Kalmus writes in a style that is very understandable. Unlike many other climate scientists, he abstains from using complicated jargon. While there is no doubt that Kalmus understands the sophisticated lingo used in climate research, he understands that part of his duty as a communicator of the climate crisis is to make his language reasonable for all people to understand. However, Kalmus does not oversimplify the language either. He is direct and clear about what he means, and when he references a word that some readers might not be familiar with, he introduces it gracefully with ample background information. 
   <br><br>

One of the most striking ideas that Kalmus presents is that his journey to cut emissions was not for the purpose of lowering the amount of carbon in that atmosphere. In this class, we have talked about a number of different ways that individuals can lower their personal carbon footprint, while also recognizing that acting solely as an individual is ineffective in the long run in terms of addressing climate change. This leads to a contradiction: why should we go vegan if we know that most people will not follow suit, and even if everyone in the world did, we would only be able to reduce a fraction of the issue?
   <br><br>

 Kalmus gives three resolutions to this conflict. He says that personally, living a less fossil fuel-intensive lifestyle has made him happier by presenting an increased connection with the food he eats, the land he lives on, and the community that surrounds him. Another reason is that lining up one’s actions with one’s beliefs helps to live them to live happier and healthier. Finally, he says that individual action helps to shift cultural norms. These three reasons are convincing as arguments for why we should all engage in personal journeys to think about how we engage with the climate.

"Being the Change" was an interesting followup to the film from last week because it allowed me to compare a scientist living a sustainable life and a scientist using cold hard evidence to back up the ease to which he creates change. I thought it was so interesting that he drives a 1984 Mercedez Benz that's fueled by waste vegetable oil, in that the fuel isn't heavily promoted by hybrid car producing companies and seems like a wonderful way to reduce CO2 emissions. In addition, in "Collective Action," I thought it was interesting that he highlighted how carbon emissions have doubled ever 32 years, and how that number is probably going to grow faster if we don't call for immediate change. "Collective Action" was a nice way to see that globally, a carbon tax could solve a lot of problems that we are currently trying to combat as climate activists. It disappoints me that we didn't take more of a stand earlier to fight for things like a carbon tax, because it feels as though we're just starting something that we should've fought for a lot earlier. We need change now more than ever, and that's evident from the Peter's writing, but it does almost feel like an uphill battle. I hope that the House of Representatives can heed this problem with the utmost urgency and lobbyists like Peter can also push forward this call to action.

I think my main takeaway from this was that it isn't hard, it just requires a little more effort than we are used to. I agree that we have to look at things on the whole. It doesn't make sense trying to combat this country by country because in truth the United States is doing so much damage that we have to be held accountable. Furthermore, a worldwide carbon tax would be beneficial, and of course its harder to implement that now, but in terms of impact it would go a long way to hold people accountable. Also, it would be taxing people accordingly. There is no better incentive than money to change the way people actively live. It’s true that it would be much easier if the government got behind this, which hopefully it will soon. Most people aren't deciding to do things because they want to harm the earth, it's just the fall back, the easier thing, the choice that doesn't take a lot of effort. If you change where the effort goes into, I guarantee people will follow.

After reading both chapters from the book Being the Change, I thought “Leaving Fossil Fuel” was more interesting and very insightful as it deepened my understanding of the ways in which I could change my personal habits to reduce my carbon footprint. Some little things he mentioned in the chapter were almost unheard of to me, for example the option of switching from diesel to VWO (vegetable waste oil). I did not know there is an alternative fuel that could be used on vehicle and do not add excessive greenhouse gas into the atmosphere. In additional to VMO, the idea of freeganism was also very unconventional to our social norms and beliefs. These details definitely add to my knowledge of the different ways in which people could contribute to solve problems that arise with climate change. On top of this, he also asserted his beliefs on how personal action could lead to cultural shift which in turn contributes to collective action. I just found his beliefs to be closely aligned with mine on the importance of individual and collective actions when we first started discussing it a few weeks ago.

Peter’s change and separation from cultural norms was fascinating.  As he mentioned, some people see no value in personal reductions and this might be because we aren’t able to see their positive effect. Not only does this change bring about great change for the environment, but it brings about a change closer to our home and community. As Peter stated living with less fossil fuels means, “more connection with the land”; there is a sense of community that grows with those around you. The change I found most interesting was his change in mode of transportation. Our culture is so stuck on cars and I’d find riding a bike to limit you to alot of things. Astonishingly, he made this work. His Kids and wife were also riding their bikes and I thought this was amazing. I find it to be a perfect way to go around, if you have the correct infrastructure in you city and if you living circumstances allow for you to do so. Overall, I was content to see that someone can make so many changes and not deprive themselves of necessities.

The things Kalmus does in order to reduce his carbon emission is very inspiring. He teaches us many ways in which we can all partake in, whether it’s going vegetarian or changing our way of transportation. I really enjoyed the fact that not only does he show us ways in which we can help slow climate change, but also shows us the results of it. He teaches us that we can all take simple steps to reduce our carbon footprint and essentially be the change we wish to see in the world. The need for us to start changing the way we live and go about each day is crucial and should be reinforced more.

I found this reading to be very informative yet still relatable. A lot of the readings that we have done throughout this course have been heavily statistic based readings that can sometimes be hard to follow and understand. It is much easier to read something like "Be The Change" because you can relate it to your life. I really enjoyed how the entire reading was filled with a lot about mindfulness because that is something that I, personally, find to be very important. Mindfulness is something that I practice and I think that it is good to talk about it while discussing climate change. This reading made me take a good hard look at myself and my life. It made me realize that I could be doing so much more for the environment. I think more people should take a look at this reading as it is a sort of wake up call.

I actually like statistic based readings more. I’ve always liked numbers, so I understand statistics much more than narrower points of view. That being said, this reading was very easy to read, much because the writer is skilled at telling a story. I remember looking at his diagram of carbon emission savings and thinking “I could also do some of that”, so I can relate to your experience in that sense. There are some things that I can’t cut out of my life though, so even though it may be a good exercise to take a look at your emissions, it’s pointless if you don’t follow through with making these changes.

After reading the two chapters in Being the Change, written by Peter Kalmus, I clearly know how powerful the personal action it is. I like Peter’s attitude that he does not think personal action as a way to save the whole world. He think what he is doing now is something he enjoys and is good for his own life, which makes the action to reduce carbon emission become a long-term, sustainable thing.
   <br><br>
Besides, Peter also encourage his readers to find their own emission profiles, which is reasonable. Because everyone’s life is unique, their profiles are also very different. For me, I am a little similar with Peter. As an international student, I need to fly every year to transfer from my homeland to Santa Barbara to further my study. Though air travel is a high carbon emission transportation, flying is a kind of inevitable thing for me. I would like to try my best to reduce individual carbon footprint in other aspects like food, daily commute, and purchase stuff. 
   <br><br>
I think these two chapter are informative and filled with data to support the author’s idea. There are some interesting concept and solution in this book. For example, Maeby, the car which consumes wasted vegetable oil. Nowadays many people cannot live without the car. This kinds of car is a good transportation for people to decrease carbon emission and enjoy the convenience of car at the same time. What’s more, the comparison among the meat eater, vegetarian, and the vegan surprises me. The average American diet emits 2,900 kg CO2e per year, slightly less than the average meat diet, since 3% of Americans are vegetarian (about half of whom are vegan). From this data, I feel that personal action is really necessary for saving the planet.

One thing that I like about Peter Kalmus in his book Being the Change is that his ideas and practices that he preaches are not at all pushy toward his audience. They are highly encouraging and something he truly believes in, but he still respects the choices of others who disagree and/or approach the climate crisis differently. I do appreciate that you acknowledge that people have different lifestyles according to their circumstances and sometimes, there is little that can be done with switching out the seemingly only option for something more environmentally friendly. For me, I avoid asking my parents to pick me up from campus for break because that would entail one more high carbon emitting vehicle on the road; though the bus takes several hours and is more inconvenient, I think that this small choice of mine is helping with the crisis. I would also hope to adopt more resourceful methods and materials into my lifestyle, see what I can do to be more efficient with what is in front of me, and promote these new choices with others.

During the reading being the change, Peter calendars introduce how he was able to take his climate foot back print down so rapidly. Interesting how he was able to figure out a different means of transportation with his vegetable oil field vehicle. But also the vegetarianism that he reduced compared to the typical American diet. Due to this, it was able to take down his climate footprint drastically because his food consumption was the second-largest climate impacting action he was making. I think that the change in diet is one of the easiest ways to impact your climate footprint and your means of transportation. For example, are you only bike transportation to get to class. It’s delightful, and I can’t exercise out of it; I also don’t have any running costs for insurance or gas, just a bicycle. A much simpler form of transportation and Mast better overall. He also talks about the carbon tax, which genuinely interests in the way that I could see happening shortly, depending on what presidential contacted me yet. I can’t say that I’ll be happy to pay more taxes, but I can’t say I’ll be satisfied with the outcome of these taxes. Or will the result change?

I agree with Mason, that when reading “Being the Change” by Peter Kalmus, I became interested in the carbon tax, and realize that this is something that could happen in the foreseeable future. In his chapter on “Collective Action”, Kalmus mentioned that in the US each year, 200,000 people die prematurely from air pollution, and a carbon fee would fix this. With the recent election, Ken has spoken to us a lot about how important it is to vote and have our voices be heard. Paying attention to who is running in these elections and what their views on climate change are, I have the power to let my voice be heard and vote for someone who supports a carbon tax. In his video lecture, Ken mentioned the five most effective things that Peter Kalmus has done for the climate as being quitting planes, vegetarianism, bicycling, freegans, and composting. I know that I will not be able to quit planes, become a vegetarian or freegan, or begin traveling only on a bicycle, but two very easy things for me to do would be composting (which I already try my best to do) and voting.

"Being the Change" by Peter Kalmus was an engaging read. The two sections we were assigned to read most definitely embodied the exact idea of actually "Being the Change". Both sections placed heavy attention directed toward personal changes. I for one, was inspired. On top of that Peter also supported his proposals with conclusions and statistics stating why making these personal changes would draw down greenhouse emissions. Not only did he effectively do both of those things, he incorporated how he made multiple personal changes. He came across with a positive approach and gave clear answers in a way that the audience would understand. I think what was really interesting about the reading was that I came out of it feeling inspired and ready to make a change. I think it's easy to understand that you need to make a change, and you can be cognizant of that, but it's another thing to be able to actually get up and make a change. I think it's a lot easier to spark change if you inspire and instill hope in your readers.

What I do admire about this reading is that it acknowledges the idea that the individual things that we can do -- the actions that we take as a person -- can be helpful, but are miniscule in the sense of actually contributing to the climate crisis. I understand that the numbers and statistics that Ken spoke of during his lecture video do make a compelling argument that the climate crisis can be solved through individual effort, but individual effort is only effective if it is done by the collective. Call me pessimistic, but there will always be people that counteract or contradict the actions of a person who has dedicated their life to combatting the climate crisis. Individual action -- no matter to what extent -- cannot solve the problem alone. 

   <br><br>

However, we are in a time of crisis (as the coined term “climate crisis’ suggests). In times of crisis, we need to take very drastic changes in order to ensure that we can solve the problem, not only now, but for the future. With that being said, I want to preface that there are bigger solutions that we need to look at in order to make sure that we can save our planet for the future generation. And, in order to make those big changes, even more hurtful growing pains will occur. Yet, greatness and innovation is forged through fire. 

   <br><br>

I am talking about the economy. When our economic system is transitioned to a sustainable development and the way that we can create jobs within the world -- especially within America -- then we can truly change the way that we affect and contribute to combating climate change. However, economical transitions come with hesitancies. How can we expect to change the entire basis of our economic system -- and the fossil fuel industry that drives it -- without hurting the people that currently have jobs in that industry and/or depend on it? We can’t. But, it is something that we must give up in order to ensure that we are doing the most to change the course of our fate. In economics, there is faith that if a new industry -- an industry that is much more innovative than the former -- replaces the old industry, then eventually, it will take the weight of the devastation the fall of the old industry had. We have to have trust in it.

I found it interesting how this article instantly pointed out that each of our carbon emission profiles is completely unique to us, and what we need to do as individuals to reduce carbon emissions is specific to our current lifestyles. While this is like a seemingly obvious assertion, I find that we often think that there is a one-way path to achieving a more sustainable lifestyle when in reality there are various actions and decisions that we can make that have a bigger impact that we may anticipate. Peter discusses that he was a frequent flyer and he would typically emit more CO2 gas annually than the average American. By cutting out flying, he significantly reduced his emissions. From here, he made other changes in his life such as switching to a vegetarian diet, and then becoming a "freegan". The changes he found necessary to make were specific to his lifestyle. These changes were not only healthy for the environment/planet, he found them to be beneficial to his health and overall quality of life. By not flying, he found himself more connected to his local community. While it seems like it kinda sucks to give up all these luxuries of modern living, there are also a lot of benefits that can be seen.

I also found it interesting that the article focuses on the individual and how every person can adjust their lifestyle in different ways. In the beginning of the chapter, he sets the stage by addressing the question, “Why reduce in the first place?” I think his answer – “I’m aligning my actions with my principles” – is a really important point when thinking whether or not to change a lifestyle. It discusses the mindset it takes to make major life adjustments like transitioning to “slow and adventurous travel” over flying, using only a car that runs of waste vegetable oil, going vegetarian, and many more. Everyone’s life and environmental footprint are different, so that is why it is so important to think about specific ways you can make less of an environmental impact, especially when it comes with benefits like increased happiness.

I really liked that Kalmus included a calculation guideline graphic in his book: "Being the Change". It allows readers to (relatively) easily calculate their annual carbon footprint. I started to do the calculations for my personal life, but I got stopped because I did not have access to my power/utility bills. However, for any other person that does have access to everything the calculations are very simple and it can help people to figure out what aspects of their lives they can focus on to lower their carbon emissions. And although I did not finish my calculations, I was able to see how much I was emitting for the things I could calculate, and I will work on reducing those sources of CO2. These things include: flying less, throwing away less stuff, and driving less.

   <br><br>

Kalmus's ideas on solutions for the community are also very good. He looks at all of the proposed solutions and is able to discern if they are viable in the long term and if they harm the public. Even better, after Kalmus explains why a particular solution will not work (cap and trade), he proposes a better option (cap and auction) and explains what it is, how it works, and why it is better than the previously dismissed solution.
   <br><br>

Both chapters were very informative and insightful into how we can commit our personal and community actions to stop climate change, by being the change.

I also like how he included a calculation guideline. I am also a very “by the numbers guy” so I did like that he included a guideline. I am currently living in the dorms so I am unsure what my carbon footprint is, but I do know that my room and the bathrooms utilize climate friendly utilities so that does make me feel better about it. I also like how the transitions did not even seem to be difficult and in some ways, they would even be better for people as they were for him.
   <br><br>

I also like how he showed just how fast he was able to lower his emissions and just how much of it was affected by only a few things. This also put into perspective for me on why Ken has really argued against flying and how some aspects, such as changing your diet, may not be enough. When flying emissions were compared to emissions from food or driving, it showed me that you can significantly reduce emissions by just not doing one single thing. I guess I just did not fully comprehend how many emissions came from flying, especially when you look at how much each generates individually.

I like how Peter Kalmus started off the chapter "Leaving Fossil Fuel" with acknowledging the fact that it can feel like one person's actions is similar to that of a drop in the vast ocean of greenhouse gases and that it'd feel like he was trying to save the world all by himself. I think it really puts into perspective the issue of global warming into very vulnerable and humanized terms. But then he goes into three things on demonstrating why he reduces his emissions - he loves doing it, he's aligning action to principle, and it shifts culture indirectly. I think that's what's important nowadays; it's to love doing what you do and by doing so creating an interested crowd willing to do the same. In order to mitigate climate change, you have to love doing what you can to stop it. I think it's important to not just try cutting beef out of your diet or trying to fly less because climate change said so. You should cut out beef and try making new recipes with other meat or no meat at all, and you should enjoy the slow travel and the long car rides and all the sightseeing that you can't do on a plane. It's not so much being optimistic about what you're cutting out as much as it is being excited about what you have left after cutting it out. What's been mentioned a lot in this class is the whole idea of a culture shift, and I really do think that's one of the best things we can do to contribute. However, with all cultural shifts and trends, it has to be fun and enjoyable. Peter does a great job at this by pointing out the good that reducing his emissions brings and what it can do for others too, thus generating an ever-growing wave of interest to change one's lifestyle.

I felt so similarly when reading Peter's piece. After I made changes in my life to try and make a difference in the battle against the climate crisis,  it felt like I had done all I could to try and fight for a better future. Reading about someone else that enjoyed advocating for a greener future made me realize that there is always something more that I can do, especially when it comes to raising awareness. So many other people don't know what they can do at all, and even more still refuse to believe there is a problem that needs fixing in the first place. Even after everything I've done, I can still always spread factual information on what the climate crisis is, what other people can personally do, and what we can do as a community to make sure the generations after us have a planet to grow up on. There are going to be times when it feels like there is no hope, or we have already done too much to harm the planet that at this point it's irreversible. Most disheartening is witnessing people outright refuse to acknowledge there is any issue at all, especially when they hold positions of power like D*nald Tr*mp that have the potential to do the most. People like Peter remind me of all those that decide to use their position for good that give me the strength to move on. It's inspirational to think about people across the globe doing everything they can for the greater good.

I really enjoyed reading how Kalmus broke down his steps to lowering his carbon emissions and how he explored the science behind it. I especially am curious to calculate my own carbon footprint and try to focus on my biggest problems. I think the way he talked about the issues and in a way showed us his thinking process. So often I hear people preach that living a sustainable lifestyle is impossible to do in our country and that it is a waste of time, and honestly, I never knew how to respond to them because I never had seen anyone who had done just that. But this class has shown me how being passionate about something can really inspire real change within us. So by getting to hear from Kalmus who has successfully implemented the necessary steps into his life to combat the climate crisis is truly inspiring and reassuring. I really liked how he mentioned SoCal Edison because I had no idea that they provided 100% renewable energy for a little extra pay, I immediately called my mom to tell her about it. Or even the little things we can change like cutting pilot lights or switching to clothinglines. I was also under the impression that carbon offsets were helpful but now I know better. The companies that plant trees will never plant enough to make a significant change and it doesn't ensure that it will be protected from deforestation, and at the end of the day, they just become a way to avoid feeling guilty. 
    <br><br>
I especially loved the section where he explained how one person's actions can shift an entire culture. Sometimes it feels pointless to change one's diet or limit one's car use because it feels like you're the only one doing it so the impact will be small, but there are 800 other students in the class and I'm sure others in the world who also want to start changing their lives for the better. It might start off with a few people, but the message of the environmental movement is spreading and with that, more people joining in. Now is the best time to come together and actually do something about this issue, we just have to be loud enough so the government can't ignore us.

Personally, I actually liked this reading better than the film about the reading. Like you, I also liked how the book broke down the steps Peter took and how it gave us a good guide to help us estimate our own emissions. I also liked how it provided examples, and (as Ken mentioned) that it was more of an "experiment." 
   <br><br>
I was also moved by the part you mentioned about shifting an entire culture, and by the end of your comments itself. It is sad to think that our individual actions can appear really small, but together we can actually make changes.






</span></div><hr>

<p>
I think a large problem that exists when it comes to addressing the climate crisis is that people may feel like their individual actions do not have much of an impact. However, I think that Peter Kalmus’ intensely factual and science-based approach when it comes to thinking in terms of your personal carbon emissions really helps to put things in perspective. This reading has really helped me realize that though it may not be obvious, our personal actions and the decisions we choose to make have the power to make a difference. 

   <br><br>

Furthermore, hearing Peter highlight the lifestyle changes he chose to make made me feel hopeful and I found it to be very empowering. He mentioned choosing to bike as much as possible instead of driving which I find to be very doable. At the very least, I hope to live in a city and make ample use of public transportation and walking when possible. Moreover, I really appreciated Kalmus’ statements regarding his diet choices. He mentioned that he switched to vegetarianism which reduced his carbon emissions by around 1500 kg a year before switching to “freeganism” in order to further reduce his food emissions by another 1000 kg. 

   <br><br>

This encourages me to make a climate change oriented plan to be aware of my own carbon footprint and think about the changes I can make on a personal level in terms of reduction in carbon emissions. I think this is a very responsible, challenging, and rewarding way of keeping ourselves accountable for our own contributions to the climate crisis.

Catherine, I agree with your assertion that many people feel that their individual actions will not have a large impact on the climate crisis. In fact, I have heard this argument made many times in my own life. This is also why I think that Kalmus' reading was particularly effective. It isn't necessarily that these lifestyle changes seem unrealistic or impractical, it is more so that many are not incentivized to implement them in their own lives because they feel that it will not make any long-term change in their own lives.
   <br><br>
This is also why I appreciated the reading so much, by hearing Kalmus lay out his calculations and the effects of his more eco-friendly lifestyle changes, I was inspired by his commitment to fighting climate change. Regardless of how effective his individual actions may be, he remains committed to this cause. While many of his lifestyle changes seemed doable and easily implemented into my own life, such as a clothesline or walking as a form of commute, I was more inspired by the calculations and effort that he puts into his writing. He lays out multiple perspectives and encourages his reader to make these changes by leading by example.
   <br><br>
Kalmus is not trying to persuade the reader of how the environment benefits from these lifestyle changes, instead he is showing the reader the importance of our own individual choices. We should not make these changes solely because they benefit the environment, we should make them with the same commitment and drive that Kalmus demonstrates in his own writing. The strength of his writing is not in the calculations or statistics, but instead in the commitment that he has to inspire others.

<br><hr>
I agree that Kalmus’ scientific manner of sharing the changes he has made to his life make “Being the Change” more impactful because it allows people to see the numbers that prove a difference is being made. The two things that I appreciate most about Peter Kalmus’ approach to writing about the climate crisis is one that he is so meticulous about his calculations, and two that he does not claim to be perfect. Kalmus acknowledges that his lifestyle still produces more emissions than the average citizen of Bangladesh, but that it also produces far below that of the average American while still allowing him to live a normal suburban life. This appeals to the people that have fears about having to give up everything they own and change everything they do in order to live a more sustainable lifestyle because it proves to them that they do not need to do so. It also appeals to the people, as you mentioned, that fear that their personal actions will make no difference because it gives them an example of someone who has not only cut down their carbon footprint massively, but someone who has shared their experience as well. Kalmus’ eagerness to share his efforts and their effects on his life has provided an amazing example that has encouraged many people to make changes in their own lifestyle. 
   <br><br>


Although Kalmus has cut down his emissions by more than a factor of ten he still claims to be somewhat of a moderate in terms of action. Due to him still having children, but having two rather than three, is a good example of why he chooses to be modest about his significant efforts and impact. This humble approach is effective because it does the opposite of what a lot of “holier than thou” environmentalists have done in the past. He does not shame people for wanting to live a “normal” life with a family but he does encourage people not to mistake this for not making any changes at all. While Kalmus does have two children, he has made changes to a lot of aspects in his life such as with the usage of “humanure” or with the modifications he made to make his car “maeby” powered by vegetable oil. 

   <br><br>

I also agree that Kalmus’ lifestyle is encouraging because quite a few of the changes he made are relatively reasonable for a lot of people and because he has laid out a way to calculate what our annual emissions look like. It is much easier to decide where to make changes if you know where you are causing the most damage. If your emissions due to driving are already quite low but you are wasting a considerable amount of food it would not be very effective to make your goal to cut down on your car use. I really enjoy your statement that this will also keep us accountable because it is important not only to start reducing our emissions but to continue doing so. It is easy to start a resolution for change and to end up quitting when it gets tough or you grow complacent, but if we want to make lasting change for the planet it is important that we follow through with our plans and work with others to keep each other accountable.

When I was reading "Be the Change," I realized my own potential to benefit our environment. An United States American single-handedly makes more of a carbon footprint than a citizen from over 100s of countries, this proves the devastation we make every, single, day. Our display of materialism is so toxic for not only our own insecurities, but also the state of our environment. We as a society need to shift to a less materialistic lifestyle and become "eco-friendly."

Yeah! I completely agree with you, the devastation the United States puts on the planet alone is so detrimental. As mentioned in the reading, I think a major part of why so many people aren't as active as they could be is because they aren't seeing enough positive change. I mean climate change itself is such a emotionally fueled topic that involves politics and the media. However, I think if the media could focus more on the positives of what people are doing to combat climate change, it will inspire others to act as well. Rather than have this negative narrative of "well it's too late for anything now". To add on, I really think Kalmus' "Be the Change" gives readers such great insight on the potential of the individual. Like Ken mentioned, Kalmus' 5 most effective actions (adopting bicyclism, quitting planes, vegetarianism, freeganism, composting) all seem like  great places to start reducing our carbon footprint. Many of these actions are simple and can have such a huge impact.

Hello, I completely understand and agree with your stance on American wastefulness. Our disregard for the well being of the environment is shameful and embarrassing, considering how this powerful and affluent this nation is. The United States of America should be leading the world in 1st world, eco-friendly lifestyles. American way of living needs to dramatically improves,  if we really care for the planet and all the living beings on it. Additionally, we should be on the forefront of utilizing renewable sources of energy and reducing toxic sources of energy. Its saddening to see our nation do little for the environment, while other countries are putting us to shame as they implement essential eco-friendly laws and lifestyles.

My initial thoughts after reading Kalmus’s chapters are that I find it extremely admirable what he has done for the planet’s well-being in reducing his and his family’s carbon output. He really highlighted the various ways one can reduce their carbon footprint, a lot less practical than others though. For example, he modified his car so that it would run on vegetable oil rather than traditional gasoline. While that is an ingenious way to watch one’s carbon footprint, I don’t think it is a practical solution in terms of widespread usage unless it becomes the mainstream method of vehicle power.

   <br><br>

And although I see the benefit in what he is doing, doing many of the things he does is simply not the viable option for me at this very moment. I live in IV, most of the appliances I use or choices I’m forced to make regarding food are not ones I have control over. I can’t live as eco-friendly as Kalmus does, it’s a simple fact. What I can do is try to cut down on my waste, which accounts for ⅓ of food production carbon footprint. In the past, I’ve been more than negligent when it comes to watching my waste, whether it be from my plate or even before I’ve started cooking in the form of wasted ingredients. I need to be more conscious, which will not only help my bank account but the planet as well.

   <br><br>

I like the idea of the carbon fee he mentioned in the second chapter. By adjusting the percentage/fixed cost of carbon usage/transportation, we could dramatically reduce emissions on a personal and corporate scale. This includes taxing plane flights, especially private plane flights, and factory emissions from large corporations to name a few. By making the tax proportionate to the carbon being emitted, this would especially discourage carbon emissions and move us one step closer to an emissions-free planet. He also mentions not focusing on economic growth in favor of sustainability and honestly, that’s been one of the best points I’ve read thus far in the quarter. This nation is so focused on getting “bigger and better” all the time, we fail to see the bigger picture. Growth means nothing if there isn’t a planet to grow on anymore, but the greed of interest groups at the top of the sociopolitical food chain look only to secure their own interests. Once we successfully remove these people from power, we can start promoting this culture of sustainability Kalmus mentioned.

I totally get where you're coming from and agree that it can be difficult to lead a more eco-friendly lifestyle in our environment as the resources provided to us aren't the best. Lacking financial security is a big thing for many students and besides using meal swipes people have to resort to using microwavable meals or snack like things that are nutritious or even not eating, so I feel like addressing food insecurity is a big thing for college students because food should be more accessible and not seen as optional. Although it isn't as easy to do what Kalmus is doing because of our environments as college students due to the fact we have a lack of control on how to design our housing, but at least I am able to contribute to the cause with using biking as a form of transportation or the bus when the distances are longer, so it feels good to have a smaller impact on the greenhouse gas effect (btw I don't have a car). I feel like the carbon fee is a step forward in a sense, but not enough as there would be corporations who wouldn't mind paying the fees or finding shortcuts as that's a common maneuver done by the rich and powerful. There is just so much going on behind the scenes, so it's just like can we really do it or are we always dealing with some pushback, but if there's a will there's a way so I'm not completely doubtful.

I think the first time I heard about peter kalamus and the lifestyle he lives, I was a bit intimidated by how extreme his methods were. My immediate reaction was “I could never live that way and nor could most of the people I know.” However, after some thought, I realized his goal was to spread awareness and give people tips for what they could do-hence the head, the hands, and the heart. I love how these three concepts interlock and relate with each other and I think he has done a great job forming a theory of what he think is the best way to mitigate this environmetal crisis.

I agree with you that I learn a lot of things that each one of us can do to decrease our greenhouse gas emissions though reading the works from Peter Kalmus. Although we have learned about these ideas like biking and eating less meat for a while, through the eyes of the scientists, we can learn something new in another perspective. He talks about many personal decisions and the positive ways that help decrease his greenhouse gas emissions. He tested different ways to help slow down climate change himself and shared his opinion with all of us.

"Being the Change" wasn't the most mind-bending reading for me. Not because I didn't agree with what he was writing, just because I already knew all of it. I had already watched his film twice, so the content wasn't that new. Sure, some details might have been, but the more important things like how he cut his airplane travel were already engrained in my brain.
   <br><br>
That being said, the information was still important and good to apply to one's own life. I plan on not flying unless absolutely necessary. I plan on biking instead of driving. I plan on eating a plant-based diet, growing my own food, composting. Are these new ideas for me? No, but they're backed up by his writing. 
   <br><br>
One thing I'm not entirely sold on is freeganism. Yes, I understand it's good not to waste food, and grocery stores waste food like crazy, but dumpster diving can NOT be good for you. I know some countries (like France? I think) have laws where food that would have been wasted goes to homeless shelters, which seems like a better use. I think we should work to get those laws in place here. For now, there is the moral quandary of leaving food in grocery store dumpsters for the homeless or people who need it to survive. Maybe I just think too much...
   <br><br>
My ultimate plan would definitely be to grow my own food and swap with neighbors. No transportation costs. Fresh. Local. Build connections with people. I love to garden. All around win-win.

I also knew all of the main ideas of this reading, especially since most of the big ones are discussed in the movie. However, it was still good to see these backed up by hard experimental data. Its one thing to hear, switching to a plant base diet can cut your carbon footprint in half but seeing how he derived his calculations and his reasoning behind all of his estimates was interesting to me. I'm a stem major so maybe that's why I enjoyed it, but I felt like this reading, unlike everything we have covered so far, was more scientifically oriented. It was kinda reading a first account of the scientific method applied to his carbon footprint.

   <br><br>

Furthermore, It was nice to see a realistic immediate approach. I know that in order to stop climate change everyone needs to go vegan and stop CO2 emissions NOW, but lets be real. It is not going to happen. Its not going to happen now or in 20 years and we'll be lucky if it happens in 50 years. The lifestyle that he is presenting is one that can be adopted immediately, without any major downsides, without a whole lot of money, without a huge time commitment, and more importantly it is one that could be appealing to the general public which, although sad, has been reluctant to implement most of the recommended environmentally conscious lifestyle choices. Like he said, it is not a complete path, but it is way better than the majority's current alternative and it seems like the most plausible intermediary step to a full transition. 

   <br><br>

Also, he never suggested dumpster diving for food as an alternative and does not do that. Rather, he saves food before it goes to the dumpster by presumably asking grocery stores for inventory that will be discarded. Dumpster diving for food is a radical extreme measure that most rational and most rational environmentalists like Peter agree that there are better alternatives, such as the one presented.


<br><hr>
I really appreciate your point of view. Compared with the previous reading, I think Peter karm's change is more comprehensive. He talked not only about how a lot of emissions are caused by waste, but also about the waste of food, the consumption of energy for transportation, and the problem of housing. These small points in life are what we have learned before. I also think this reading is very attractive, and I have had countless resonance in the whole process. I have always firmly believed that the constant appeal for the seriousness of environmental damage and the importance of environmental protection can make some people gradually start to change their living conditions and habits. They will also advocate that some people around them work together for this. But environmental protection is not something that can be done by a person, a city or a country. This matter needs the joint efforts of the whole world. It's nice to have someone who can lead through their own change, but I would like more people to make changes in the future.

I generally don’t like playing devil’s advocate and, to this point in the quarter, I generally haven’t felt the need to do so in these comments. In this case, though, I have to disagree with Ken’s premise regarding Peter Kalmus and his ability to reach the intended audience. In his video discussing the reading, Ken noted that Peter’s story is that much more powerful because he is a scientist. As someone who was already relatively uninspired by Kalmus in the documentary “Being the Change” (at least relative to some of the other content Ken has exposed us to) I felt that the fact that Kalmus is a scientist by trade places unnecessary separation between viewers and the changes that he makes. In the reading, for instance, I found his description of the household sources of emissions he was able to reduce overwhelming. Even having been given instruction in terms of how to calculate my own emissions and make substantial changes, it just comes off like he is only able to make such sweeping changes because he is a scientist. This goes back to the comment someone made about his car which we discussed in class last week. While it is great that Kalmus was able to modify his car to run on vegetable oil, and I absolutely applaud him for doing so, I think that it is bold to say that that sort of behavior is easily replicable. 
   <br><br>
Don’t get me wrong, I am impressed by the changes Kalmus has made and think that he is doing great work in terms of reducing his own emissions and spreading knowledge so that others may do the same. At the same time, despite his claim that anyone can maintain a middle class lifestyle while making those changes, I think that most people who aren’t already inclined to make significant lifestyle changes will completely write off most of what he says because he is a scientist. I think that those people are better off seeing change in a more relatable and realistic form. With all of that being said, I was still glad to see the focus in the other chapter on structural and policy-based carbon limiting strategies. I have been a proponent of a carbon tax for a long time and agree that those types of policies are our best hope for sweeping change.

In "Being the Change," it was interesting to see the different points that Peter Kalmus did not make in the film. He allows for intimate moments with the readers, more specifically when he talks about our "unique" carbon emissions and how it will be very different compared to his. Doing this, I really felt the impact that individual activism can have. He also goes in debt with the different ways that he cut down emissions, i.e. air/car travel, food, electricity, etc. And discusses how people may rationalize with the airplane example. I used to think that only a group effort could create real change. But reading this, I know that one person can cause a chain reaction and have a bigger impact. "Collective Action" was also interesting because it goes into a more specific way that individual action or any change can directly affect our politics, and our emissions in benefitting the planet.  My favorite subtopic was "Fight in the Courts" because it mentions hows "kids are suing the U.S. government on the grounds that the defendants have a constitutional obligation to protect the atmosphere for future generations." Knowing this is cool because I really think it emphasizes the necessity for change. And it lets people in higher powers be aware that this will not just affect them but generations to come, if we even make it that far.
   <br><br>

Before taking this class, I assumed that the only way I could help the environment was by going vegan and basically living a minimalist life. But after watching the documentary from last week's lecture and reading these two chapters from "Being the Change" I've learned that I could focus on small changes first like biking when I can or being a "climatarian/flexitarian." Peter Kalmus used an immense amount of carbon emissions but completely changed his lifestyle and was able to successfully cut down his carbon footprint by a lot. I think this was very inspirational to read about because it gives me reassurance that anyone can do it and will do it. There is no doubt in my mind that the climate crisis is anthropogenic and because of that, I think humans have a responsibility now more than ever to make a change. Greenhouse gas emissions and their production are unfortunately heavily-embedded in American culture. But through small changes like what Peter Kalmus and his family did, I think there is hope.

It is true that after reading Peter Kalmus’ Being the Change, the action, the way to help the environment becomes clear. As you said, before taking the class, people may only know one thing about how to change the environment. For me, I only know that taking public transportation can help a lot in the environment, while I don’t know the food diet can also have a lot of impacts on climate change. After taking ENGL 23, Ken offers many different areas of how to change the environment. However, those areas are big and hard to act by myself like the video said. And Peter Kalmus solve this problem. He did not only list what we can do, but also showing the statistic of the efficiency of the action. Different than others, the actions Peter lists is not ideal, but actually performed by himself.

After learning about Peter Kalmus these last two weeks, his life has made an impact on the way I look at life. Often I think to myself, “hey, whatever changes I make in my life won’t really make an impact” and “hey, one person can not change the world on their own.” However, learning about Peter and his life changed my mind. Peter himself said “Finally, I believe personal reduction does help, indirectly, by shifting the culture.” This is obviously true because I am sure that him changing his life impacted many people on Earth. This made me think that any lifestyle changes that I make can impact those around me, such as friends and family. However, other than changing my personal lifestyle, I understand the importance of change happening in the government. At the end of the day, the government holds the power over things such as carbon taxes. So, what I am trying to say is, make sure you exercise your right to vote!

I also liked how informative it was on what the individual can do. Peter Kalmus is a very intelligent man who has the resources and opportunities to make a significant change in his life to limit his climate emissions, but between the documentary and this reading we find out that he is more like us than we would think. He has two kids and uses his climate activism in order to strengthen his family ties by biking his kids to school. He does small things that we can all do such as drying clothes with a clothesline rather than a machine dryer and replacing high-waste light bulbs. Because he relates to the everyday family man in both the documentary and the reading, he inspires others to make a change. People will think "If this guy can make a change with two kids while still being able to live a happy life where he gets to do everything he wants, then why can't i?"

In this week's reading of Being the Change, by Peter Kalmus, chapter 2 specifically which described how he personally moved away from fossil fuels, caught my attention. The way he decided to take action and reduce his own carbon footprint was inspiring to me, especially when he discussed how flying can drastically impact your footprint. We have discussed flying in past lectures but hearing how Peter reduced his impact simply by cutting flying out of his lifestyle. I didn’t realize how big of an impact flying had on one's carbon footprint, especially domestic flying or even flying business/first class. If I was simply to stop flying I could save so much CO2 from being put into the atmosphere, and I can’t use the excuse anymore that the flight would be happening anyway because that’s how excuses are made in Peter’s own words. It is hard for me personally however, because I love to travel and if I have stopped flying that means I can’t really see other parts of the world unless I want to spend days,weeks, or even months on a ship. But when debating saving the environment versus my own leisure activities, I would rather prioritize the environment. Another inspiring message that Peter really made me think about was how much stuff I buy a year because his 4 person household roughly spends 4,000$ a year on stuff. But I personally am a shop-a-holic and I know I spend too much money on clothes and random junk I probably don’t need. If I were to simply cut back on my excessive spending habits I think I could significantly reduce my carbon footprint by even more. These two things could make a huge difference along with the fact that I’m already a vegetarian. Simple fixes such as the ones that Peter discussed could help people realize that cutting carbon out doesn’t have to be that hard.

AlyssaFirst, I really appreciate your opinions. From this reading, I was shocked that flying can produce so many environmental problems. In the previous learning, the most impressive example is when someone takes a plane from Los Angeles to Paris, he will produce three tons of carbon dioxide. To reduce my flying, what we should do is reduce our fights. Although people will choose planes to travel since it is the fastest way to get to the destination, we can travel in a slower way. For example, traveling by trains instead of planes. Ken states that trains are the most efficient transportation now. Although we may spend more time in our ways, it will reduce a lot of pollution and increase resource utilization rates. To think about that, our work and study are always in a high-speed way, why don’t we slow down in our travel and to enjoy our life. Moreover, I also spend a lot of money buying clothes and things that I always just use one time. It is a bad habit that I need to reduce and limit my consumption style. It can not only reduce waste and pollution, but also helps me to save money.

I loved being able to read the thought processes and statistics behind each of the changes that Peter made throughout his life. I loved seeing the cold hard statistics and his rationalization for changing things the way that he did. He is a prime example of someone who has made a significant change in his carbon impact by changing his lifestyle. The quanitification of his actions and the change in his actions is something that I significantly appreciate because if gives me a concrete grip on how my actions contribute to my carbon footprint. I absolutely loved how he provided us with a means to calculate our own carbon footprint. The chart that he gave us was really helpful as it gave me a quanitifiable understanding of how much carbon I personally am releasing into the  world.
   <br><br>

Overall, I thought this was perhaps the most interesting reading that we've had all quarter. The facts are presented straight at me. Nothing was to confusing, and it was super easy to understand. I can see why Ken chose this reading to give to us. I look forward changing my own lifestyle to be more similar to his, and I can not wait to live a more proactive climate lifestyle.

Jason I couldn’t agree more this reading “Being the change” was exemplary. It was written in a way where you could put yourself in the shoes of Pete and think of ways on how to reduce ones own carbon footprint. Through various solutions Pete discovered you see yourself thinking on ho be w to apply and implement all the solutions Pete found to be put in your everyday life. The data provided to the reader was really great I did not find myself unable to comprehend the scientific facts that were thrown out by the author but actually better understand the circumstances. Overall great read.

"Being the Change" is about a man and how he changed his lifestyle to become more environmentally friendly. The one thing that stuck out to me the most is taking accountability for the footprint that we are ultimately leaving behind. Just because the plane is going to fly without you on it, doesn't mean that that should be an excuse to get on the plane as well. And just because red meat will still be produced and sold, doesn't mean that that should be an excuse to eat it as well. It's hard to look at yourself as the problem when you know for a fact that whether you partake in activities that hurt the climate or not it will still happen. We need to be more accountable to ourselves and we have to be able to correct ourselves when we know that we are doing wrong. Less driving, less waste, less traveling, as discussed in these chapters can actually be easy and should be something that we all start to look at and move towards. A change in diet is one of the easiest ways to reduce your climate footprint and it is very attainable for mostly everyone. We are circling back to the first part of the class where Ken had explained that even reducing meat consumption a few days a week or switching to chicken or fish as alternatives is exactly what the author is proposing now. We should be being conscious of how what we are eating, our modes of transportation, the waste that we produce. This class has gone from personal action to political action and then back to personal action. I personally like the personal action portion of this class more because it seems more attainable to hold myself accountable as opposed to trying to make a difference nationally when a lot of different factors come into play with politics. Protecting the planet can also lead to a healthier lifestyle overall, and can make you happier anyway. We can exercise by walking or riding a bike and not only is it environmentally friendly, but it's also healthier for selfish reasons.

I agree that what stuck with me about this reading is one's own personal actions to the climate crisis. We have the privilege to be more conscious about the lifestyles we make because we live in America, and we have more options than other countries. Just because people are already getting on the plane, and because meat is available for our consumption, it does not mean we too have to take part in it. When we do eat meat or get on that plane, we are creating a demand. I understand that it's difficult to change our daily habits, and it may feel like what one person alone does, does not matter but if everyone changed it would make a big difference.

Kalmus' book: "Being the Change",  was for me, way more informative than his documentary of the same name. I think that was done on purpose because documentaries appeal to a wider range of audience, while books are only good for the ones who truly care about the situation and want to make a change. His book, as ken pointed out, is almost like the other half of Project Draw Down, telling the individuals what they can do to change the climate their way. It is not some big shot actions like converting to nuclear, but to waste less energy, bike,  have more climate-friendly diets...etc. His calculations for how much our actions could help is also a huge inspiration for those who do want to approach the method, and each step they do they will know exactly how much they are helping the planet. What is even better about his methods is that they don't need expensive equipment like solar panels, but just clothespins to hang wet clothes. Contrasting to this, he also acknowledges that more actions are needed to be taken, and thus collective action is needed. Although personal actions are good, a fracking company can just wipe out all of our hard work. Thus, we need to stop relying on fossil fuel and realize that it is like smoking or many other types of market failure that is in need of a tax due to its negative effect on society.

I also enjoyed the readings much more than the film! I watched the film before the reading and I hate to admit I was pretty bored and often found myself not paying attention. However, during the readings, I didn't want to stop! I plan on reading the rest of the material and I also want to watch the film again as I realized I didn't really pay attention haha. I really liked how he said we can cast a vote simply by changing the way we live and think! I found this thought so powerful. We often times see our vote as an every four-year type of thing which can bring a lot of discouragement, but seeing our every day lives as a vote makes me realize we are much more responsible and have much more say so in how the world is run and sustained!


<br><hr>

I think it’s interesting that you point out the difference between the documentary and the book is the scale of the changes that need to be implemented. For instance, the documentary, which I would argue can reach a wider audience, focuses on the bigger picture of changes, less so dealing with what changes individuals can make. On the other hand, the book focuses more on the individual changes that can be made, and I agree with you that it would be more for those who truly care about the topic and want to further make a change. However, I question if this makes sense. Wouldn’t it be better for the documentary to fully discuss individual changes that people can make if it has the possibility of reaching a wider audience? I feel like it would have been an opportunity to further educate people who may not realize how much they should care, and inspire them to start making changes. If you already weren’t fully invested in making a change, wouldn’t watching a documentary about changes that bigger institutions have to make just discourage you from the issue? Also, I totally agree with you in terms of viewing fossil fuels as a form of market failure. It’s time we understand these negative externalities in the human population, and  start taxing those responsible. It’s just extremely discouraging knowing these large companies and institutions can undo all the change ordinary people are trying to make. It blows my mind that they are still not being held responsible to the extent to which they should be. I just can’t believe they got to be so powerful, and somehow invincible.




<br><hr>
In response to Toan, I agree. It is like smoking. I think that a carbon tax would be most beneficial because people are scared of money. People will finally have to start paying the price of their actions instead of the planet. The people that cause the biggest problems are responsible for fixing them. 
   <br><br>

Peter says that his 5 most effective methods of depleting his carbon footprint were quitting planes, vegetarianism, bicyclism, freedom, and composting. While Peter does acknowledge the many issues we’ve discussed in the class such as transportation, he gives us ways to make changes that will produce results. One way that really resonated for me, simply because of its simplicity was the idea of using a clothes line. What surprised me was how effective the simple idea was. And, for the first time, I felt like I wasn’t being asked to do something completely horrible. 
   <br><br>

The way Peter presents his argument is most appealing to me. He presents it in a manageable way that will ultimately lead to not only a better planet but potentially a happier person. He doesn’t say we need to cut things out but the happy medium which is just less. Less air travel, less red meat, less shopping, less driving. It seems better that we just have to cut it out a little but not altogether.





<br><hr>

I also appreciated the difference between his documentary and book that highlighted the potential changes one can make directly to their lifestyle as highlighted by his familial and communal experiences and then the fact-driven explanation of the transition that Americans and our system must undergo to address climate change. Personally, I believe I can make changes to my life by reducing the amount of food waste, material objects, and transport (by using public transport more) in my life; however, I admit I am unsure about other suggestion that Kalmus discusses in the reading such as stopping the use of a car due to my feeling of its necessity. I think what I can take out of his suggestions is being aware of climate footprint and the contribution it has to the emission of CO2 equivalents, which is why I also appreciated the calculations he placed in the chapter that individuals could estimate themselves.
   <br><br>

I agree that the need for climate activism is vital to making changes to our system and with the primary election just passing, I am happy to say that I made use of my vote as it was my first time and am aware that it doesn’t stop here. By supporting the policies that Kalmus brings up, we demonstrate as a public that we recognized a need for our government to transition to a system that benefits our planet while still sustaining the American economy in order to avoid an aftermath of devastation for the American people. What felt discouraging was reading about how the U.S. court and oil companies shutting down the fight in court with OUr Children’s Trust, disregarding the case. While I think the policies such as cap-and-trade, carbon fee, and encouragement of international collaboration is extremely vital, I found the half-earth alternative extremely unrealistic and that it would never be supported by the majority.

When people think about changing their personal habits, it’s really hard for them to even fathom how to change one thing. I think a lot of us can agree that, when you’re so used to living on fossil fuels it becomes especially challenging when you realize that a change in habits would not only be doing you a huge favor, but it would be doing the environment huge favor too. Peter’s breakdown of how he personally benefits from cutting fossil fuels out of his life was really inspiring, and I like that he emphasizes that it is definitely possible. The process takes time though (which he also emphasizes) and I think that people who truly do want to change their fossil fuel dependent lifestyles forget to realize that it takes a lot of time. Like Peter says, everyone’s lifestyle habits are different, so it may be easier for some to become vegetarian than others for example, but with time it becomes more possible. Peter does a great job at connecting personal change with the facts surrounding climate change. He uses data and graphs for his own personal use of fossil fuels in 2010, which is helpful when comparing the average Americans use because it kind of gives you hope on how to tweak your own personal habits. For example, I don’t use air travel or a car, but I do eat red meat, which is something I’ve begun to cut back on.
   <br><br>

In “Collective Action”, I was really glad that he discussed the carbon tax because I find myself kind of lost on why people disagree with it. I feel like people are just really stubborn and don’t like the idea of their actions being under control. I mean, I feel like there’s a successful way to go about implementing a carbon fee, but people are too stubborn to even consider it. It’s hard for some people to grasp the idea of being taxed for anything that's emitting carbon, but in my opinion, it’s the most effective way to reduce carbon emissions within a population.

Jessica Harris I also appreciated that Peter included a breakdown of his personal fossil fuel use, I thought that it was very helpful to visualize individual carbon usage. I don’t think most Americans realize the magnitude of their carbon footprint, the left side of Kalmus’ graph looked monstrous with a giant area. This graph made me realize just how severely an individual’s carbon footprint can be cut down. As you mentioned, Kalmus also points out that everyone’s carbon footprint looks different, whether their biggest contribution comes from food, driving, or electricity. 
   <br><br>
I also agree with the first part of your comment, we as Americans currently live a life of convenience. So many things we do are thoughtless, we consume without thought, we drive everywhere, and we use resources like they’re free. It is so difficult to be willing to relinquish that convenience so many of us are born into. The realization that I don’t want to give up my comfortable life, even though I know I have to if I want things to improve, makes me feel incredibly selfish. However, Kalmus’ documentary and readings have helped me realize that life without resource intensive luxuries is not primitive and sad, its grounds for hope and excitement.


<br><hr>
I think Kalmus brought up some really good reasons as to why a carbon fee would be an effective solution, however I believe it contradicts his statements about aligning morals with actions since it would be morally wrong to impose a tax that limits freedom in a 'free' society. It is also extremely unlikely that Congress will pass legislation that returns carbon fee proceeds back to the taxpayer. Even if that does happens, a carbon fee will nonetheless severely impact the lower and middle working class since they are the ones that for the most part MUST commute using fossil fuels in order to maintain a job. The wealthy, those who emit the majority of fossil fuels, most likely will not be substantially affected by a carbon fee since they will be able to pay it without drastically altering their lifestyles. Also, it means that today's society must foot the bill of effects from generations passed and that is not a solution that seems morally sound.

Peter Kalmus's "Be the Change," once again opened my eyes to something I didn't think was practical. The more I hear about other people actually creating these changes in their life makes me want to do the same. And I think that's one thing Peter noted in this reading. Society has such a big impact on how we do things as human beings. For example, it is socially unacceptable to be biking to and from work, many people will often assume you're too poor to own a car or don't know how to drive when it could be the complete opposite. You may be even richer than the person that's making fun of you because you're riding a bike to and from work. I truly believe that the domino effect is real. Once people make things a trend, popular, everyone else follows suit no So, matter how ridiculous it may seem because as humans, we want to be accepted. 

   <br><br>

Thus, I feel like if I saw all my friends and family and everyone around me change their diet, their transportation method, their spending habits, their living habits, I would definitely be inclined to changing my lifestyle too. It is easier said than done when we talk about what changes we can make to our life. Talking about it, coming up with ideas is one thing but to actually execute it is something entirely different. I was actually glad to see how Peter gave up his lavish lifestyle of flying everywhere for work to communicating by bike or public transportation or creating a clothesline to dry their clothes and giving up a drying machine. He realized the damage he was doing to the Earth and it's was nice reading that and seeing how people can reflect on their own choices. This makes me want to have a clothesline but in IV, that's a bit hard. I really do think that the environment you live in also affects what you can and cannot change. I agree with my fellow classmate who said it is hard to switch to wind-solar energy or a plant-based diet. Especially where vegetables and fruits are much more expensive than a bag of junk food. As I said, the environment controls what you can and cannot do. Sure there are some loopholes but some things, you simply cannot change.

I completely agree with your opinions regarding these readings. I truly think that becoming environmentally conscious with our actions isn't always a question about whether an action is feasible or not because a lot of the changes listed in Kalmus's article was not too much of a commitment to change such as cutting food waste. Rather it is more of a societal problem that stems from our individual desires to conform and be viewed by others in a negative light. Your example of bikers being viewed as poor or bad drivers is very relevant because a large number of people I know felt the same way in high school where it was more acceptable and cool for someone to get a flashy new car for their birthday that would likely be very bad for the environment than getting a new bike. The same goes for things like veganism and vegetarianism from my personal experience as well, where lots of my peers would associate vegans with overdramatic and aggressive activists who attacked anyone for even looking at meat. It definitely lowers the chances of people wanting to learn more about these kinds of environmentally conscious lifestyle changes, and is something that needs to be rectified if we want everyone to get on board. Humans are societal creatures that learn through observation of others so it needs to be a collaborative effort to redefine the benefits of being environmentally conscious.
   <br><br>

That being said, sometimes it is a question of whether a lifestyle change is realistic or not depending on your life situation. Living in IV where robberies are super common, I don't think I would be open to using a clothesline to dry my clothes out in the open (even though my washer and drier usually is broken and loses me money occasionally). In that case, its understandable that there are limitations to what we can do to make a change. For now, I think I want to focus on things that I can control however, such as monitoring my food waste and doing more thrifting instead of department shopping. Any change no matter how big or small is a step in the right direction, so that's what really matters in the end.

Interesting lifestyle changes by Mr.Kalmus. Undoubtedly. But I fear that many of these changes are not accessible to the average American. Even if they were, only a tiny percentage of the population knows about these changes and an even smaller percentage would be willing to make changes. So yeah, we're screwed. 
   <br><br>

It feels almost pointless so make personal changes because we all know that 99% of the world are unaware of these matters and that we are in our little "progressive" and well-educated bubble. I feel as if a class such as Eng 23 should be a basic graduation requirement. No, it should've been a basic req 20 years ago. Alas, I fear that it is now too late.
   <br><br>
On another note, I'm confused about the whole meditation business. I mean yes, meditation can reduces stress but all the rest just seems like pseudo-science to me. Not quite sure why meditation is relevant here.

I found this week's reading of Peter Kalmus’ “Being the Change” very upsetting and yet beneficial. I say this for a couple of reasons. The most significant reason was that it left me feeling a little guilty. No one likes to admit they are also part of the problem, and that they need to change their habits. I was guilty of thinking, on more than one occasion, “well, the plane is going to go anyway, I might as well be on it”. I used this excuse to justify my travels, because I knew what they were doing to the planet and I really just wanted a loophole. Reading this was upsetting because it felt like I was being called out, but I needed to be called out. We cannot go on thinking this way because then nothing will ever change. And yes, it will require sacrifices that we really, really don't like. But what is worse than those sacrifices now are the inevitable sacrifices we will have to make when our world is going up in flames. I’d much rather face reality and live a slightly less comfortable life right now than face the reality of what will happen if we didn't start making changes and being the change. This reading was definitely the wake up call that I needed and opened my eyes to so many things I could be changing. I eat a vegan diet, don't drive too much, recycle, shop very rarely, and do my best to conserve energy, so I thought I was good. It sucks to admit, but that's just not enough. Great steps, yes. But not enough. This reading is useful in that it has its reader look inward and as what they are doing to solve a problem and if it is enough.

This was a great comment. I really liked how you reflected on yourself and saw that change needs to occur. Not everybody has the same mindset as you and I’m really impressed and inspired by you. I also have the problem of not liking to be called out. I mean I don’t think anybody does. I know that I need to change many things about my life and I’ve already started to, but it’s not good enough. I need to sacrifice more than I already have because I too would rather live a less comfortable life now, than not be able to make the changes necessary in the future to save the planet. To me this whole class has been a wake up call, and everybody in this culture needs to change, but it starts with one person, you/me. This class has also made me feel very guilty and every time I fly home or have to fly, I feel quite bad about it, but currently my parents won’t let me find alternatives. This was a very good reading, because like this comment said, it made the reader assess themselves. The reader has to deal with themselves, or they have to change and find ways to improve, which is what the purpose of this reading was.

I think it was very beneficial for Ken to have us watch the movie and read the book. I liked the movie a lot because it made Peter's story feel a lot more personal and intriguing. I think it made a lot of sense for us to watch the movie first because a lot of people find it easier to learn with a visual representation. It was a lot less confusing to have to read the book when we already saw exactly what changes Peter had made. It drew the focus more toward the numbers and how exactly your carbon footprint and emissions could be changed rather than the personal and more heart to heart effect that the film gave. I found it really interesting to read about the carbon fees and cap-and-trade. I kind of always thought of the two terms as interchangeable but the reading helped me realize that there are major differences between the two. I think this helps in the aspect of voting as well. Now I know a little more about what policies would be best to vote for rather than just blindly voting for whatever Democrat says they'll create policies to mitigate the climate crisis. The last thing we want to do is dig ourselves into an even bigger whole of corruption. I think Peter does a good job of explaining that the climate crisis gives us a chance to start fresh and we should keep in mind the consequences and benefits of each proposed solution.

I agree that the movie was intriguing in the sense that it made the ideas he was trying to portray into somewhat tangible ones, since we followed his journey and process of how he did it.  The visual representation made is easy to follow his thought processes for his climate centered decisions, such as switching to vegetable oil for his car or riding a bike as often as he could. The reading, for me personally, was almost too detailed for what he was trying to convey. Sure, if you are still skeptical about climate change the amount of data and facts that he presents makes a compelling argument in almost every facet of live for us to move towards more sustainable options. Since i am already on-board with the ideas of climate change, however, I found it somewhat dramatic to give me such detailed analysis on how every little action could affect my emissions. I do recognize the importance of data and metrics, and since it is a numbers game for our emissions, the detailed approach is a great way to make a credible argument. Additionally, these numbers give a good sense to us as individuals, what impact we can have if we make changes, which he even went as far as to include a rough calculator that the reader is able to use. 

   <br><br>

In my experience, however, the abundance of these numbers will only confuse an audience, especially if most of it is on the other side or still deciding. I think the movie is a great summation of his argument, and the book is really meant for those who aim to be well-versed on the ideas. In my opinion, i would rather try and implement such changes that he suggests like composting and using carbon-friendly transportation, or even voting for things like CTAD, rather than read about them but not be able to do anything. I think now is the only time we have to act, so trying to get as many people on board with climate-friendly actions needs to be a priority, whether it be through sustainable living or bi-partisan policies for the benefit of all.

The reading “Being the Change” shows how does the author reduce his emissions to the atmosphere and how does he do to help mitigate the climate crisis and change the world. It is really informative and reflective since he presents a good example of how individuals could do. Moreover, the author shows that these actions, including less driving, less waste, and less air travel, are actually easy to do and they can be done happily. It is attractive to me. I would probably follow his steps, or at least try my best to reduce pollutions and emissions to protect the planet and also create a healthier and happier life.

I agree. I was shocked to hear that flying counts for so much of a person's CO2 emissions, and I will be very aware about my flying from now on. He made his sustainable lifestyle seem almost more convenient than a non-sustainable one, which has made me inspired to lead one myself.


<br><hr>

I agree with you Yuning. The reading "Being the Change" makes me feel bad but inspiring. In my opinion, his writing is a way of activism. He is very similar to Ken that both of them have a kind mind to help the planet. Individual actions are small, but more people like Ken or the author of "Being the Change" can and will make a significant impact. I am not shocked about the carbon dioxide emissions by air travels, because we have talked so many times in the class and the lecture videos. I often feel regret for air travel after taking this course, and I will try my best to minimize the number of air travel times. It is also a great reading for everyone to join this lifestyle, because it provides the readers a template for people to follow.
    <br><br>

The carbon tax he mentioned is a great way to reduce the carbon emissions. However, I think education is more important than carbon tax. I believe most of the students will pay more attention to the climate crisis and try their best to reduce greenhouse gases emissions after they finish this course. Therefore, it is more important to start more courses similar to English 23 in the future in different universities and even k12 schools. Carbon tax is more like a way of monetary penalty, and most people will reduce the carbon footprints because they want to avoid the extra payments.



<br><Hr>
I agree with you. This book describes the main ways of carbon dioxide emissions and how to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Of course, these are not new. For peter's calculation of his own carbon emissions, I also tried to calculate my own carbon emissions. My main carbon emissions come from food (meat), transportation, including cars and airplanes, and electricity. I think my carbon emissions should be above average. I will take some ways in the future, including reducing food waste and green travel, in order to reduce my carbon emissions. But one of my favorite sentences in the book is "I find that actions aimed at the personal and actions aimed at the collective are mutually reinforcing. I see no reason not to do both." I think it is difficult for individuals to change the trend of global warming. We need government intervention to implement everything more effectively.

In the readings, I learned how each person has a different way of affecting the gas emissions since everyone has different lifestyles. It was a very interesting and formal reading. I was also amazed when the reading distinguished the average American from the distinguished amount of CO2  which states, “ The act of flying is an exercise of privilege. Globally, only about 5% of humans have ever flown.10 The average American emits about 1,000 kg CO211 per year from flying,12 which is roughly equivalent to one 4,000-mile round-trip between Los Angeles and Chicago. In 2010, however, I flew 50,000 miles, equivalent to two transatlantic and six domestic flights. My flights that year resulted in 16 metric tonnes of CO2…” I was interested in how they used  their personal lives to distinguish what they can improve and this relates to everyone that we need to reflect on our actions. We need to distinguish what ways we change to help improve the environment and improve our conditions. I repeated a lot to the reading because it emphasizes on how he started to consume less and he started to be more happy and positive. I started recently to stop buying more stuff and actually I felt more better and confident with myself. I was also able to distinguish the possible solutions that they were explaining about food waste and other scenarios.

I really agree with you. In the reading Being the Change by peter, I learn some actions to decrease my own footprint. And in the first article, he claims that people finally will enjoy that kind of lifestyle. People who only eat vegetables and drive less because they enjoy it, they do not seem these actions to protect the planet. For me as example, when I go home, I always take bus or ride public bicycle instead of driving car. In my opinion, taking public transportation is cheap and faster. If you drive car, it always meets traffic jam. Also, when I ride bicycles, I do the exercise as well. So, I really willing to take public transportation and my aim is not to protect the environment. However, my actions truly protect the earth.

I personally liked how Peter was able to show the public, or those that read/watched his information, that one can individually assist the planet by reducing their carbon emissions. I also believe though that a lot of the things that he was able to do and alter in his life came to his financial abilities and his own intelligence. Personally, I know there is no way that I would be able to convert my car to be more environmentally efficient by using vegetable oil as I know that I do not have the knowledge nor the ability to do as Peter did. While I know that I personally could not convert my car to be environmentally efficient I could utilize my space and land by growing my own food and housing my own animals like chickens which is something I have always wanted to do and it was really cool to see someone actually doing that. In his career it must be shocking to his colleagues, his lifestyle, as he is well off and has the means to have a luxurious lifestyle with nice cars, houses, property, clothing, etc. I too would be shocked if I was his colleague seeing him live the way that he does, but it is not like Peter doesn't live in a nice house in a nice neighborhood, because he does. I understand that it was easier for Peter to switch his lifestyle as he had the financial means and the time to do so, but for most people, especially in countries that have citizens working to death, it is not easy and reasonable to switch to a more environmentally friendly lifestyle. Yes, one can easily stop flying and stop driving as a way to lower their footprint and save themselves money that could then be put back into their own homes and lifestyles, but sadly I do not think most people would want to do that.
   <br><br>

I personally want to be as environmentally efficient as I can be but I would also like to have the free will to live my life and I do not think I would be able to stop flying and stop driving my car. I do believe that Peter is a great example as to what people should strive to do and his lifestyle should become desirable by all people but I think that it would take a widespread of his beliefs and of climate change beliefs to initiate this change. I really liked how Peter was living his life and it made me happy seeing how happy Peter and his family were/are even though they are not living the "average" American lifestyle and by no means are the considered a normal family in the eyes of those around the world. I think that people need to adopt this type of lifestyle whether less or more than Peter and I think that not only would that help the climate, but it would also help the people of the world become happier and more prosperous for their future life.

One thing that I appreciated while reading Peter Kalmus’ chapter on his own personal challenge to reduce his emissions was the point he made about doing it for himself as much as he was doing it for the environment. A lot of the apprehension that surrounds these purportedly extreme green lifestyles is that they’re impractical, difficult to achieve, and make things more tedious. What is needed to make these lifestyles possible is only a change in mindset as Kalmus noted. Being closer to nature, eating better food, and spending less money are all arguably good for us as much as it is good for the environment. Furthermore, by conceptualizing and quantifying the impact of our daily actions, Kalmus makes a good point in arguing that we become more conscientious of the impacts we create. For example, the impact of not flying and practicing a more climate aware diet makes such a difference. If people knew the statistics surrounding each of their environmental choices, people would be more prone to making better decisions. 
   <br><br>

Peter Kalmus’ argument on collective action was also very compelling. By assessing the shortcomings and pitfalls of pollutions permits through cap and trade compared to carbon fees, Kalmus proposes a new solution to an old problem. By showing how British Columbia has succeeded with a carbon fee policy is also very encouraging. Ultimately, I do hope that through lobbying and petitioning carbon fees will become a more relevant platform for politicians, but bipartisan support is a major caveat. Going into the 2020 elections, politics seem to be getting more and more divisive and honestly, I’m not optimistic about any sort of significant bipartisan support in Congress.

I definitely agree that changing your mindset about why you want to reduce your emissions is very important. I think most people focus too much on what they would be giving up - like eating meat, driving their car, living in a big house - and don't focus enough on what they could gain. Reading about how Peter Kalmus' lifestyle changes improved his life was really inspiring. As you said, we need to stop the misconception that making these changes is impractical or impossible.
   <br><br>
One thing I have to disagree with, however, is that you stated that people would be more prone to making better decisions if they knew the statistics of each of their environmental actions. Although I would like to believe that this is true, I fear that many people simply don't care about their carbon footprint. Kalmus mentioned the example of flying. I think many people are aware of the fact that planes are very damaging to our environment, yet they refuse to stop using them. Instead, they come up with excuses like "the plane would have flown anyway, even without me" or "I simply have to travel for work" and try to justify their actions and reduce any guilt they might be feeling deep down. We are all inclined to excuse our bad behaviors instead of taking full responsibility and improving them. 
   <br><br>
So in that sense, I'm afraid that statistics and facts aren't enough to persuade people to change their habits. Maybe what we need to do is offer alternatives that make others feel like they are not losing as much. Another thing that can be really powerful is talking about countries or individuals that have already successfully implemented these changes. That's why I agree with you that mentioning British Columbia and their carbon fee was really encouraging. I also love hearing about specific people that have changed their everyday lives and are still just as happy - if not happier - than they were before. Maybe we can all use those examples as inspirations and finally realize that change is possible.

I like this week’s reading because it zoomed out of his personal life and focused more on the broad picture of what we can all do to limit our own emissions. Something that caught my attention was how Kalmus put details into numbers and even showed the readers how they could calculate their own emission levels. Another thing that came to mind after I had finished reading was that each action that the author gives as a way to reduce emissions is left for the reader’s personal interpretation and lifestyle. He gives many examples that Ken has given us such as having a more plant based diet as well as reducing air travel, but he also gives his audience alternate actions that they can take instead. He talks a little about freeganism and how he implements some things such as composting and growing his own food in order to reduce his own emissions. I found the graph that demonstrates the differences between his 2010 and 2014 greenhouse gas emissions and  the pie chart used to demonstrate the spread of his emissions over seven categories interesting and very helpful because it put the effects of his actions into visuals. This chapter, which focuses on the actions that we can take to make a change not only gives the readers a list of things that they can do, but it also offers insight into how much CO2 everyday items emit.
   <br><br>
I found Kalmus’ argument for collective action to be very moving and compelling. He shows his readers the drawbacks with cap-and-trade and proposes that we should introduce a carbon tax. He also argues that personal reduction of greenhouse gas emissions indirectly “shift[s] the culture and I think that throughout the film and these chapters, he demonstrates how one can take action in his/her life in order to reduce emissions and take a step towards the direction of change.

I really enjoyed this week’s reading as well! I thought that Kalmus did an amazing job balancing his credibility as a climate scientist and his similarity as a person just like us. He shows that it’s possible for one person, one family to accomplish decreasing their emissions in order to support a sustainable but valuable lifestyle. I appreciated that his suggestions for reducing emissions mirrored the ones Ken has been emphasizing this whole quarter. The most compelling action to me was growing my own produce – an element of freeganism. Especially after the panel in class on Friday, I’m very interested in the communal gardens championed by Eco Vista. Not only would it be convenient and make living much more affordable for college students in IV, but it would help the environment as well. Kalmus’s explanation of how the average American’s greenhouse gas emissions are broken down in each section was helpful for me to comprehend what I’m doing that negatively affects the environment and how I can change. Then, being able to calculate an estimate of my personal emissions put into perspective the necessity of taking action. 
Reading the second chapter that was assigned reminded me that the climate crisis must be addressed in the government as well as in our everyday lives. I thought that his argument for a carbon fee as opposed to a carbon tax was compelling. It would act as an economic boost, encourage consumer spending, and create jobs. Although many people would be opposed to it because it would raise the prices of airplane tickets, gas, and fossil-fueled energy, it would ultimately act as an incentive for vast institutional change. Corporations would be forced to explore other energy and fuel options. I agree with you that his ability to lay out all of the facts gives me hope that personal change and political action can save our earth.

Something to note is that being able to surround yourself in this kind of community is an extreme privilege. To even be able to create, and drive, a vegetable oil-driven car is a privilege in itself. Peter has access and income to the resources to be able to achieve such a thing. I strongly admire how Peter incorporates his morals into his own life, it shows that he really cares about the environment and takes the responsibility for his own carbon footprint. His lifestyle is an extreme form of reducing carbon footprint but he sets a standard for other people to follow. He shows that it isn't impossible to create change-- your own individual actions really do make a difference. Peter Kalmus is an inspiration and his work is extremely important.

After reading the article “Being the Change” by Peter Kalmus, I got further into the idea about the reduction of an individual’s greenhouse emissions. I love the story about how Peter’s actions influence the rest of the world, including his own family. It surprised me that it is not that kind of hard for Peter to do those things. Instead, he really enjoys it, to live with this ecofriendly lifestyle. He emphasizes he is happy during the process of reducing carbon footprints. As far as I am concerned, we should adopt this kind of lifestyle. It is not only for the earth but also for us, to live with a healthier and happier life.

I did the same Jiarui. After reading "Being the Change" by Peter Kalmus, I was very optimistic about ideas of reducing one's carbon footprint through personal action. It was very nice and pleasing to see Peter state his influence through other people and especially his family. Being able to shift to his lifestyle and convincing his wife and kids to change is very dynamic. At a young age is the perfect way to build a child's lifestyle. Being able to influence other people is very challenging especially for a whole group. But influencing one person can drastically start a chain reaction which is much more effective than a group effort. It's truly inspiring to see Peter live his lifestyle. It shows how living a minimalistic lifestyle is realistic and Peter really enjoys living an eco-friendly lifestyle.


<br><Hr>
Besides all the facts that were given in the reading, I was mostly intrigued by the positive effect it had on Peter and his family. Although it might have been a challenge at the beginning, Peter was able to adjusts because of a sense of community he was able to gain through this change.  I agree, we should adapt to this kind of lifestyle. Even though not everyone will be able to make these changes due to personal circumstances, just changing one thing about your lifestyle can make a great change
<br><Hr>
I too after reading this felt like I needed to make a bigger change to my lifestyle. It definitely is hard however when looking at others and comparing yourself, knowing that they emit so much more CO2 than you do personally, but if everyone had this view, nothing would ever change. I do believe that although personal action is important, if the government doesn't show any interest in making a change, tens of millions of people will refuse to as well. They are going to continue to believe that it is a hoax.

I enjoyed "Be the Change" as it employs a different attitude and solutions to the same problems. I find it important how it states that the most effective way to limit your carbon emission is to be aware of exactly how much you are putting out. By calculating kg of CO2 released for travel, resources, food, waste, and stuff, you are much more likely to be conscious of your decisions and how they affect the environment. By tracking numbers, you are accurately staying under the recommended yearly carbon emission instead of just ballparking it. Oftentimes, expectations for your own carbon emissions would be biased and will exceed what you think you really put out.
   <br><br>
I also agree that the suggestion to put a carbon fee and dividend is effective. Sadly in this society, money is one of the only universal motivators, especially for the wealthy. By forcing people to become aware of their actions and pay for their carbon emissions would create a much more fair playing field for the poorer inhabitants of the earth.

yeah, carbon fee and dividend would be great.. but i don't think it will ever be implemented. Kalmus' ideas are great though and he has changed his life so much as to reduce his emissions while still living in this society. One point that I want to bring up is that even Kalmus stated that he is not even near someone in Bangladesh or something. Instead of going through all these drastic measures, why not simplify your life and just live like a Bangladeshi? its not hard, its simple. all you gotta do is move there or live like they are living. people there have way less than even Peter does, and i think this is where a lot of confusion spreads in terms of making your life more sustainable. yo don't need all these fancy solutions like solar panels  or hybrid cars or electric bikes... all you have to do is simplify your life. a lot of people just don't get this.

In "Being the Change," Peter Kalmus expounds on the simple lifestyle changes that people can implement to tackle the problems caused by the excessive CO2 release in our planet. He breaks this down by providing information on why we should bring down our vehicle use, air travel, power usage, and food waste. He goes on to mention that lifestyle alterations like these not only contribute to the happiness of our planet but that he himself, as well as members of his family, feel happier with this lifestyle. Changes like these should definitely feel rewarding, and that feeling is well-earned. Committing to a plant-based diet is not necessarily easy and there is happiness in knowing you are serving yourself and your planet by doing so. Change by any means is better than no change at all, regardless of how minor it may feel. One individual alone can not generate an enormous improvement for the crisis, but combined efforts from numerous people definitely can. From the reading, I found that each shift in our current ways and culture has a significant impact on our own fossil fuel emissions--raising awareness locally, empowering and motivating others, and ultimately joining together for this unified cause has an impact beyond our communities.

I totally agree with you Chloe, there are so many feelings of satisfaction that can come with making the lifestyle changes necessary in order to improve the current state of our planet. Making these changes definitely isn’t easy, especially if you’ve grown up your whole life living completely differently. However, our combined efforts in making them is the only way we will see change, which is why sooner or later I believe we will all have to come together to make them. I think most of the reason many people aren't making these changes has to do with the simple fact that they are unaware of just how much they are damaging the planet by doing things such as consuming meat, using forms of air travel, driving, purchasing an excess amount of clothing, and even things such as using a drying machine (something I wasn’t even aware releases so much carbon dioxide before reading). This is one of the many reasons I believe so many people aren’t concerned about the climate crisis we currently face; they are simply unaware of its seriousness. I was definitely not as motivated to make lifestyle changes in the beginning of this quarter as I am now, but thanks to this class, I’ve learned much more of just how serious of an issue this really is and the things I can be doing to help improve it.

Peter's idea to hang dry all of his clothing is something I've never thought of before. Hang drying is something that I feel like I can definitely do and will try to do going forward. I'm surprised that something like that can have such an impact. Things like that go to show that there are so many small things we can each do to greatly reduce our emissions. Reading the chapter really made me realize how lucky we are to have the luxuries that we take for granted everyday compared to the rest of the world and how much better off we would be if we chose not to use them. We all have the choice to step by step do all of the little things that will, in the end, make the difference. We need to recognize we have the choice then exercise the choice.

I agree with you on the basis that we are very lucky to have the luxuries that others unfortunately won't experience and that we all have the choice to make a difference as a whole; whether it be little by little or immediately. The ideas expressed in Kalmus's book highlight the sustainable actions we can all individually take to fight the climate crisis, some being using the method of composting to reduce food waste, adopting a plant based diet instead of consuming beef, and by all means avoiding the use of air and car travel as a traveling method. It's interesting to see just how much you can accomplish if you really set your mind to it. Kalmus is a prime example of this. Just within the span of two years he was able to dramatically reduce his annual emissions by simply transitioning to a vegetarian diet, adopting freegan values, aggressively composting and biking. As he mentions in the chapter "Collective Action," his personal actions exemplifies what life would be without fossil fuels, but if we were all to collectively change our life styles, we would have a greater chance of avoiding catastrophic events and immensely reduce emissions all while (possibly) making us much more happy. I believe introducing a carbon tax would eventually drive industries and the general to adopt more sustainable options and to think twice before making a decision that would prove to be environmentally disastrous. It's sad that such taxes or fees must be enforced in order to even make people think about changing their lifestyles, but there unfortunately is no other option that makes it easier to mobilize an eco-friendly movement among the masses because all in all, money talks.

While reading this week’s articles, I was surprised by how his article had so many statistics and I felt like it was a good touch to add the pie charts to allow people to visualize their own carbon emission in a simple form. I know it wouldn’t be the same as Peter’s but it could be very similar or in one section, it would take up a lot of carbon emission. I think it took a lot of courage to realize how much carbon emission he was releasing to the atmosphere and actually taking an action where he stopped flying as frequently because in one year, he spent almost 50,000 miles just on flying and that is equivalent to 16 metric tons of carbon emission. He already blew his carbon emission for the year! Like that is absolutely crazy to me that he was able to do that in one year. I’m happy for him for understanding his carbon emission and how it has an influence on the biosphere. He actually understood his influence and decided to change his living habits which is a hard thing to do. It’s amazing when people change their lifestyle after finding out their carbon emission because if they never found out, they would constantly release tons of metric carbon emission. 

   <br><br>

In his other article, he talks about a collaborative action such as imposing a tax on carbon emission and how if enough people ask for it, eventually, there will be a carbon emission tax which could drastically reduce carbon emission in the atmosphere because people don’t want to pay as much for something they don’t need. I also think it’s sad that the Kyoto Protocol was ignored because it didn’t get enough recognition and no one really supported it.

I agree! I think it is fantastic that Peter realizes how much CO2 is released into the atmosphere and changed his lifestyle to reduce his carbon footprint. I liked how Peter argued that his level of reduction still allowed him to live a normal suburban life, which meant that this type of similar reduction is well within reach for many of us as well. He then listed out how he made this possible; he cut down on flying and driving while reducing emissions from food waste. He also became vegetarian, started growing his own food, and obtained much of his food from the waste stream.
   <br><br>
I loved how Peter addressed the common argument of how individual-level reductions do not make a difference for the planet as a myth; it is unfortunate that many people think this way and do not attempt to change their lifestyles because they perceive it as meaningless and a waste of time. Many people think this way because their primary motivations are to reduce global emissions, which is nearly impossible to do by yourself. Peter states that we should rather be motivated to align our actions with our principles, so we can be satisfied and encouraged in a more personal way. 
   <br><br>
Ultimately, it really is fascinating how Peter applied such drastic changes to his lifestyle. I especially admire how he decided to grow his food and pursue a vegetarian diet. As Ken mentions, it's difficult for many college students to apply Peter's changes, but every small step makes a difference.


<br><Hr>

I totally agree with your comment. I thought it was important that Peter explains that while he advocates for personal change and obviously implemented it in his own life, he acknowledges that this is not the be all and end all to the climate crisis. I like how he said personal change was important as it helps us make a difference by limiting our carbon usage and how it had made him personally more happy in life, but we needed to focus on widespread collective change to really make a difference. This concept of widespread change is what he really focuses in one of the articles. He goes into what we have to do, why we have to do it, and how we can make it happen. I think it was a really good narrative as it presented the issues on a grand scale and then delved into the details and semantics of it. He also has such a cool perspective as he is both a scientist so he knows the facts and science of the issues, but he has also made so many personal sacrifices he can speak to the social and emotional effects. I think his reasons for speaking out as a scientist were very powerful as he talked about thinking of the vulnerable and voiceless, and then the decision to speak out is easy. I think more scientists need to think this way instead of just focusing on the facts. 
   <br><br>
We have talked about the Carbon tax many times throughout the class and I am so intrigued by the concept. Like Ken was saying in his introduction video, Americans are not going to cut fossil fuels and carbon especially when our society rewards the behavior. How can we expect people to do this without an incentive beyond the climate. The fact is that the general public will not start acting until political change is implemented. If there is one thing Americans hate worse that change is high prices and losing money. I believe Americans will be willing to change their lifestyles if the carbon rich ways become enormously taxed.

I agree with Betty, I find that having visuals like those drawn out statistics are helpful in better demonstrating our play into climate change. I specifically liked reading the statistic chart on the different cultural aspects of our lifestyle we can change in order to reduce the amount of CO2 we are currently producing. I also agree with your statement on Peter Kalmus, it is quite admirable that he was able to make a step back to look at his habits as a consumer and decide to make drastic changes for the good of our planet. I genuinely think we are all capable of doing something like this (to an extent ofcourse), personally I’d focus on a couple of aspects regarding the issue rather than overwhelming ourselves in thinking we can completely change our lifestyle without hard work and major cut backs. 
   <br><br>


 I would view this weeks reading as a list of different cultural and consumption changes we can opt for changing. For example the section on waste was especially interesting to read about as it focuses on several types of waste and how it is it comes to have an affect on our environment while being an issue we don’t necessarily think twice about. Knowing that sending our waste still adds a huge amount to the amount of CO2 generated, has to have us thinking in more efficient ways (even more efficient than decomposing) to get rid of an issue many of us don’t ever second-guess. My personal take-aways from the reading are that of the waste and for section, again reminding me that every choice we make throughout our lifetime has a much bigger affect globally than we really think about. I am also in line with the idea of imposing a carbon tax, as discussed in class may have some negative stigma and attention as people’s habits are forcefully being shifted but in the long run the benefits will highly outweigh any negative.

Hi Daniel! I also agree with you that every effort does play a role in reducing carbon emission and if I’m being honest, I understand how hard it is for someone to change their lifestyle suddenly because they’re so used to the way they have been living. That is one of the reasons why I think Peter’s actions are admirable because he didn’t even doubt whether he wanted this or not but he did it for the future right after he found out his carbon emission. As a group, we can collectively reduce emissions by only doing a couple things such as reducing food waste and traveling by utilizing different transportation types. I think taking this class has helped me conscious of my own actions and how it affects others even though it does make guilty about the things I have used to far but I think it’s better to know now than any later before carbon emission becomes worse.

I think that I really like the fact that Peter Kalmus is a scientist that focuses on his role as a human like the rest of the public would– in a weird way, this documentary and accompanying chapters somewhat humanize scientists. I think that in a world with constant stimulation, constant new research coming out, constant background noise full of new-findings there is a distance that is created between the public being informed and the "scientists" that are doing research; it is strange to stop and think about how much these people are defined by their career and nothing else. I think that there is power in the fact that Peter Kalmus is a scientist and an activist– it bridges the gap that has been made between scientists and the rest of the world. I think that showing how much a scientist is willing to change their everyday life as a result of research is powerful, I think it can communicate urgency. 
   <br><br>
While I think the film was a step in the right direction, and made with good intention, Kalmus' quirks could distract viewers and detract from the message of the film. However, the readings were quite the opposite: easy to understand and including some powerful written words that resonated. I found that Kalmus' calling attention to not only personal action, but activism is especially incredible considering, once again, that he is a scientist.

What I enjoyed most about this week's reading was how Kalmus explained how bad his lifestyle used to be and what he did to change it to encourage the reader to reflect on their own personal emissions profile. You can tell from this week's reading and the film Kalmus is genuinely in this issue without shoving it down other people's throat or making the reader feel guilty. It was also presented well with facts and other visuals to further sell the point. Hearing Ken mention the chapter's five most effective actions made me feel a lot better knowing I have changed my ways to the majority of those listed. Kalmus also describes how reducing aligns actions with principles doesn't make you feel guilty and shifts the culture. This  is something I have personally experienced now that I am a vegetarian. I feel a lot better knowing I put my words to actions in reducing my carbon footprint. However,  I feel being here at UCSB and having two roommates who are also vegetarian contributed a lot. It was sad to know that upgrading old appliances can be so expensive that many people won't buy them. It is frustrating that the population is advertised to spend more money on unnecessary objects that contribute to the problem while those who want to upgrade to more sustainable items most likely can't. Nonetheless, there are many other ways everyone can do to help out the Earth.

I agree with many of the points that you made throughout your comment. I also enjoyed how Kalmus informed his readers on what his lifestyle looked like before he decided to take a step back and reassess his priorities and began to reduce his personal carbon footprint. I was inspired to use his calculator and estimate my own emissions and use that to make informed decisions on how to reduce my emissions. Kalmus made it easy to find out how much we emit into the atmosphere which none of the other readings, films, or lectures allowed us to do. I also never realized how there are things like using a clothing line to dry our clothes instead of using dryers that can help reduce our emissions. While using a clothing line to dry my clothes is a good idea back at home where I have space to set up the line and hang my clothes, I don't see myself doing that here where I live in a dorm room and there isn't much room to hang dry my clothes. I also feel a lot better knowing that I am putting my words into actions and reducing my carbon footprint by taking public transportation, switching over to a plant based diet, and saving energy in any way that I can. I believe that we can all find things in our daily lives that can change to help reduce our emissions.

I think this reading was a nice juxtaposition to the film inspired by this book. It focused more on facts and data, as compared to the more spiritual and emotional aspects of the film. I think by producing both types of media, it will draw a larger and more diverse audience. I think my favorite part of these readings was a brief paragraph in the “Leaving Fossil Fuel” chapter that discussed the cognitive dissonance that many people struggle with in terms of climate change. Many people by now understand that burning fossil fuels is harmful for the environment, which can lead people to feel guilty for their actions. But instead of making a change, they simply try to convince themselves that what they are doing isn’t that bad or that one person making a change will not make a difference. This is an incredibly dangerous way of thinking. I think it can be compared to many American’s attitudes towards voting. “I am only one person, my vote can’t actually make a difference”. But when the collective majority of people share this mindset, then progress is nearly impossible. Like Kalmus mentioned, by making positive and sustainable individual lifestyle changes, you can inspire others around you to do the same. Each person has more individual influence than they think they do. This will help get the ball rolling on the massive cultural shift that needs to happen if we are to make serious progress in the fight against climate change.

While I was not a huge fan of Peter Kalmus’s documentary, I did really enjoy these chapters from his book. Kalmus communicates his points in each chapter in an effective manner by breaking down each subject into its own paragraph, and by providing data, graphs and facts to back it all up. It shows he put a lot of effort into making sure he was communicating accurately without giving generalizations. From chapter 9, the points I thought were best were in regards to aligning our actions with our principles and values, air travel, and the recipe he gives for each person to analyze their own emissions. As for the point of aligning our actions and principles, I think this is something that people need to do more, not just in regards to climate change, but in all aspects of one’s life. I appreciate the fact that Kalmus points this out. Change can only happen if we truly, deep down, actually believe in something. If we do, then it really shouldn’t be a problem to act on that belief, especially with climate change. There are so many small steps that each person can take that do not negatively impact our lives, many of which we are aware of now, that will make a substantial difference to the fight against climate change. In addition, I appreciate how he talks about how air travel is a privilege, and it should be treated as one. We think of flying as just another way to get from point A to point B, without ever thinking about how that impacts the rest of the world. People need to become aware of how damaging flying is to the environment, and that it should really only be done if entirely necessary. I hope we get to a point where this becomes common knowledge, or that when people buy a plane ticket, there is some notice that shows how many emissions will come from that trip. It would be a quick way to raise awareness of how bad air travel is. Unfortunately, airline companies would probably never disclose that, at least not willingly, as it would probably result in less people flying, and less money for them. And it’s all about the money. The recipe he offers for people to consider their own emissions was incredibly useful as well. By offering a simple formula to gauge our household emissions, Kalmus gives us a way for us to take a closer, more accurate look at how we are impacting the environment. Chapter 14 had very useful points as well, especially with discussing the carbon tax and cap and trade. I am all for a carbon tax, and agree that it would address many aspects of climate change from fossil fuels. I do hope our government actually implements this, as they are the only ones who can. But first we do need to reform our political system. This is easier said than done, as like Kalmus notes, corporate lobbying dominates the political sphere. And I agree with him heavily in that corporate lobbying should really be illegal. It is unfair that corporations have so much influence in our politics. Politics should be about the people, not the narrow interests of a few massive companies that seek to better themselves financially. It is entirely unfair, and has cost everyone so much time, money and effort. I wish Kalmus touched more on the political sphere, and how the decisions made there are negatively impacting every person and the environment, but realistically the topic would need a whole book dedicated to it for us to really understand how deeply rooted these problems are.

It is true that market failure are always being excluded from the economic profits, however, not a lot of people actually realize it's such an important component that we are missing from the economic and environmental issue. 

   <br><br>

      Before I did the reading and watched Ken’s video, I always thought about the biggest problems led to this climate crisis is from the technology problem, but now I know our daily lives especially when we talk about food production, is such an important factor causing global warming as well. 

   <br><br>

     Kalmu’s reading allows me to understand that what we are doing in lives are actually causing the emission of greenhouse gases, and how much emission human activities are causing. He is such an inspiring climate activist. What his actions allowing me to see a possibility to bring changes to what we all are facing. People are afraid of changes because they don’t want to see and know what they are doing are harming the planet and they are scared to change to styles of lives they have been living,e.g. We all rely on technology so much and we love buying so much stuff we don’t actually need. But Kamula’s example makes us see that we can make changes while having a good balance at the same time. It is possible to do something that doesn't bring us huge personal huge and at the same time highly environmentally friendly.

I definitely agree with your comment. Like you, I also realize that 'market failure' is often misunderstood or ignored when dealing with environmental issue. I tend to believe that economic issues are often ignored due to the fact that they are seen as the devil or the underlying issue that caused climate crisis, because of how firms and the consequences of industrialization are massively expanding in pursuit of profits. Similarly, I agree with your point regarding Kalmu's reading, I like the fact that he highlights that people do not want to be disturbed from their 'comfort zones'. Hence, comfort zones are often seen as dangerous zones because people who over indulge to this concept also allows themselves to be vulnerable from naivete. Hence, like you said, "People are afraid of changes because they don't want to see and know what they are doing are harming the planet..."

I enjoyed this reading because I do agree, as Ken stated, that a more individual approach is provided by author Kalmus. I liked his critique on people’s comment that “the plane would have flown anyway.” This is a very similar concept to people who combat vegetarians or vegans by stating that “the animal would have been murdered anyway.” What many people fail to realize is that the less demand there is for flights, or for meat, there will eventually be less flights scheduled and animals killed. I also thought the personal emission calculator was helpful so people can see their actual impact on the planet. I was amazed that when Kalmus went vegetarian he reduced CO2 emissions by 1500 kg per year. This definitely made me feel a lot better about my choice to be vegetarian, but my congratulatory period soon ended when he talked about car emissions. It seems almost impossible to not be dependent on my car after four years of consistently using it for everything and anything, but I know I need to make a change and this change can be as easy or difficult as I make it. The portion on new stuff also resonated with me, as I spend a lot of my money on buying useless clothing. Hearing that each dollar spent on stuff represents ½ a kilogram of CO2 emissions will definitely help me reduce my purchases.

I think both of these readings were really insightful. The first reading really helped me understand what we can do moving forward in order to stop the detrimental everyday usage of carbon. Before reading this chapter I had no clue what the difference was between cap and trade and auctioned caps nor did I understand the difference between a fee and a tax. However, I now understand these concepts and think that they are very important to implement in the upcoming years. It is especially important that we develop a carbon fee as this is the one method that can help us transition in a way that is affordable and beneficial to those that are less fortunate and use less carbon than others.  At the end of the day this all comes back to the same concept that Ken has been stressing this entire quarter: Voting. We need more people to become aware of their actions and to vote for candidates that support a greener future. If we do not we will continue down this damaging path and leave nothing but a disaster for future generations to come.

I found the chapter on leaving fossil fuels behind a little redundant but nevertheless it was a good review of what we have learned in this class so far. However, this reading did make me think more about how the use of fossil fuels is integrated into our learning system. Everyday kids attend colleges all over the world and often times these schools are very far away from home. This encourages kids to fly or drive, burning lots of fossil fuels frequently throughout the year. This happens everytime we get a break from school and is especially true for international kids who fly back home over break. What is unfortunate is that it seems as if colleges frequently accept kids that are from out of state instead of local kids in order to receive a much higher tuition payment. 
   <br><br>

I would like to leave off this comment with a quote that I found very important: 
   <br><br>

“As I discussed in Chapter 5, a sustainable human civilization will require us to reorganize around an economic system that doesn’t depend on growth. We’ll also need to find a way to maintain a stable population within the Earth’s carrying capacity. One way or another, either through conscious planning or col- lapse, physics requires that our current growth-based system must change.
    <br><br>
We need strict new campaign finance laws: corporations must not be allowed to con- tribute to political campaigns, and neither should any sort of organization. We need a system in which politicians aren’t expected to or allowed to accept money from donors. And corporate lobbying should quite simply be illegal.45”

Peter Kalmus just really impresses me. It’s one thing to be aware of what is going on with our climate. It’s another thing to offer solutions and lifestyle changes to reduce emissions. It’s ANOTHER thing to actually practice everything you preach and be an example for everyone else of how to live during our global climate crisis.
    <br><br>
The fact that he was able to estimate his own personal emissions and then make lifestyle changes to reduce them by a factor of ten was astounding. I’m a stats major, and I love numbers and graphs and all that, so reading chapter nine inspired me to attempt to start recording my emissions next month and work to reduce them.
    <br><br>
Before reading this I was convinced that personal lifestyle changes won’t make a big difference. And it is true that we ultimately will need policy changes to prevent catastrophe. But Kalmus is right. Personal changes can start a shift in the culture, leading to more people accepting it as the norm. Plus, reducing the amount of emissions we as people personally use, energy usage for example, will allow the transition from fossil fuels to clean energy to be less drastic since not as much energy would be being demanded by people.
    <br><br>
I have been pessimistic about our climate crisis ever since I fully understood it my senior year of high school. But people like Peter Kalmus give me hope. Maybe we have a chance. Just Maeby.

I agree! Well I usually do hang my clothing all the time instead of using a dryer machine. I sometimes even wash my clothing by hand. It is honestly a great experience every time I do it. I just never really felt good about it until now that I learned about the great things that peter did.
   <br><br>
I have also considered the idea of being a vegetarian. I actually once tried to become one but my parents convinced me that nothing would come out of it and that it was not sustainable. Little did they know that eating meat was actually worst. But they back then, like me, they did not know about the climate crisis or heard of it but never really understood it. However, I will be considering vegetarian slowly as I progress the 2020 year. Kalmas really is right about personal changes being key to cultural change. The more we spread a change in culture, the more known it will be and the more normal it may seem to others. Therefore, it will be seen more often. I like Kalman takes advantage of his scientific knowledge to create change. That certainly motivated me to see my scientic knowledge in biology and chemistry as valuable to understand the climate crisis. Hopefully I can also use what I know and create a unique change like peter did,

"Kalmus is not just calculating what sort of emissions reductions are possible, he is actually testing to see if this is possible, let alone rewarding." I think Kalmus approach to climate change is incredibly profound, and possibly the best example of climate change action in this course thus far. In his documentary of the same name, Kalmus asserts that the most effective way to inspire change is to lead by example. The reason Kalmus achieves this is because he is simply relatable. His motives and his actions are for the most part something we could all see ourselves participating in ourselves, and it shows when reading through these comments. Until last week I had not been exposed to the concept of freeganism and so I was very happy to get more exposure to it this week as well. I am suprised that we are only touching on it now because it seems to be such an obvious way to minimize such a huge problem. Food production accounts for 1/3 of our global emissions and 1/3 of said food is wasted. Thus, a whopping 1/6 of our emissions serve no functional purpose.  There are two ways to address this issue: 1. make food production more environmentally efficient via technological advancements and 2. reduce food waste.  Freeganism is an ideal approach to the second method. Additionally, there are many ways to reduce the amount of food you throw out at home. In my own home, me and my dad repackage all of our produce into reusable glass Tupperware to make it last longer, prep our weekly dinners, and freeze our meet which we buy in bulk. Although we do spend our nearly our entire Sunday on this process, it has reduced our grocery budget dramatically by maximizing our yeild.

Kassie I agree with your thoughts on Kalmus' approach to climate change. I would disagree with you on your assertion that his is the best example of climate change action in the course thus far; I would argue that collective action is far more important than individual action, and the person who enacted the most collectivist/widespread change would be the most influential. But I'm just being pedantic. I agree with Kalmus that the best way to lead is by example. There is an ancient proverbial story that mentions much of the same. The proverb goes something like, I wanted to change the world as a kid, but when I realized that wasn't possible just my nation, and when that wasn't possible just my city and so on. Eventually the narrator realizes that if he had just changed his own actions, he would have been able to enact more widespread change. I have to admit that freeganism sounds kind of ... apalling to me. I cannot imagine completely giving my current lifestyle in terms of food. I think that the best way to go about enacting food change is making food production more environmentally efficient via technological advances. The second option you mentioned, getting less food wasted is probably the more ideal goal-- but practically I cannot envision it happening. I really commend your dedication to not wasting food!

We all want to be happy. Yet global warming is accelerating as we go on a spending spree in the pursuit of happiness. Alarmed by the dramatic changes taking place in the earth's climate system, the authors began by cycling, growing food, meditating, and making other simple, satisfying changes. Eventually, he reduced his climate impact to less than a tenth of the American average, and became happier in the process. The existence of change explores the connection between our daily behavior as individuals and our collective plight. It combines science, spirituality and practical action to develop a satisfactory and appropriate response to global warming. These chapters offer a clear and unprecedented response: a conscious choice to leave this broken system and align our daily lives with the biosphere. The core message is very optimistic: living without fossil fuels is not only possible, it can be better. When I experience some success, my mind is excited and full of pleasant feelings. I feel bigger, like I have more stuff. "I know it's not happiness. On the contrary, the ego is exaggerated. I think we often mistake this self-motivation for happiness. This is a mistake: it leads us to pursue things that will ultimately increase our pain. True happiness does not depend on external circumstances. On the contrary, it is a feeling of peace and health, a feeling of satisfaction and completeness, a feeling of living well, a joy in the happiness of others. True happiness is free from anxiety and hunger. It is filled with gratitude, which translates into a desire to help others and spread happiness. Unlike self-motivation, true happiness is directed at others and at life as a whole.

Reading about the ways Peter worked to reduce his emissions was a lot more organized and clear. I wish we can have official outlines and procedures in the U.S. that we must follow by law in an effort to reduce emissions more logically and simpler like the way Peter's methods exhibited. I like that he explains that yes, at first it is extremely difficult, but you gain a new sense of self upon accustoming to the practices. First, community is what comes about with making a change. Then, a sense of purpose and almost new image of yourself ensues upon making a change and that is important to me because this class has consistently made me feel guilty about my day to day practices. The last one is a change in others and this one really gets me because I remember I would always overlook the fact that all my friends were drinking alternative milks and turning vegan and I even scoffed at it sometimes, considering it trendy and a fad, and I apologize for that. My friends have changed me and I aspire to change others too. I aspire to drive a car like Peter that runs on veggie oil and be a master at measuring carbon emissions to allow me to inform others. This change in others ultimately promotes that collective action we need to make an actual difference.

I found Peter Kalmus’ book really interesting. I didn’t find it much different from any of the information we’ve already learned in the class, however his means of explaining his objectives and tips are really earnest. I feel his means of communication were really effective and I kept noticing how the way he communicated them through examples, hypotheticals and stories connected to last week’s reading “Communicating Climate Change Science,” and I personally found it really effective in thinking about ways I could change my actions in my life. I think this reading contrasted significantly from the film because he used a lot more scientific jargon, statistics and data, which I felt made him seem more reliable instead of just a guy giving random advice. I think this film and reading will be really helpful in educating people on the importance and the impact that making smaller continual changes in your daily life can make. I think that approach can help make environmentally friendly changes seem less overwhelming and more approachable and holistic, and steps for a better life for you as well as the planet.
    <br><br>
I also think his actions are really motivating as a means of being innovative in order to combat the climate crisis- for example the veggie oil powered car.

I also agree with the following comment and also thought that there was not much new information in this reading other than what we have already learned previously. Although the tips and personal accounts he included were good touches that are actually quite inspiring and encouraging while reading. When reading, I felt as though encouraged to hop in and join the change and felt the urge to start changing small things in my life to help better the world. I like how the reading emphasizes the reality that we are not going to be able to enable change in every single person all at once, which is why we need to focus on ourselves and implement personal action in order to influence others to do so also, then creating change one step at a time.

This week’s reading allows me to have a glimpse at how Peter Kalmus cuts his carbon footprint to 1/10 of an average American. I deeply respect what he has completed in terms of personal action and how he has influenced his family to live a more environmental-friendly life. As far as I’m concerned, his personal acts are feasible such as bicycling. It really helps to reduce the traffic jam and reduce carbon dioxide emission. Regarding the statement that “climate change is a result of the greatest market failure”, I quite agree with this point as it’s a failure to disturb resources evenly across the planet. Some people are enjoying a high cost of living while some are suffering to satisfy basic housing needs. As the second chapter is named as Collective Action, each individual can contribute to an innovational and systematic change. It’s possible for us to change the world little by little and together we will make a big difference.

After reading Kalmus’s two chapters, I feel like he adequately addressed the ways we can personally and collectively change our fossil fuel dependent lifestyles that are disastrous to the environment. One of the early points he made was that by becoming less dependent on fossil fuels, we can have an overall more personal connection with the land, food, and people around us. This is right since this fossil fuel lifestyle has left people more concerned about satisfying themselves at the expense of the planet, animals, and other people. Kalmus also points out the importance of enacting a “carbon fee” (as opposed to a carbon tax, since Americans hate the idea of taxes) that would charge carbon emitters for harming the environment to maintain their consumer lifestyles, while taking into account that the poorest 20% of Americans are only responsible for 9% of emissions therefore they would be favored over the wealthy-who make up the majority of carbon emissions. But like Kalmus said, a carbon fee is a big step, but still not enough. We need to collectively reorganize our economic system and become less focused on growth and more focused on supporting local economies. Kalmus notes many ways we can reduce our carbon footprint individually, from less flying to composting; to collective action such as educating woman and making contraceptives accessible.

After reading the chapter, I realized there are lots of things that I'm capable of and easier for me to achieve. For me, I think I can learn about the lifestyle of Peter, such as reducing the meat I eat. Even though I cannot become a vegan, I can still try my best to eat less meat, especially beef. In addition, I start to realize when I pay for something, I should use the same method to calculate approximately what is the CO2 emission of that product I bought. By doing this, I can realize some product contains too much CO2, then I will buy less of it.

I agree that we can adopt many of the practices that will reduce our impact while still being practical for us to implement. I have cut down on red meat consumption and make the decision to avoid it when I can. Being away at school also reduces my carbon footprint because all my transportation is via bike or bus as opposed to my own car at home. It is definitely easier to consume less here since I am trying to save money when I can which causes me to purchase much less. There are many choices you can make daily that reduce your footprint if you are conscious of the impact your choices will have.


<br><hr>
I do agree with you on the fact that there are so many things that we are capable of doing today or right now. On top of just meat reduction, I will choose more locally grown produce to avoid imported ones where emissions took place during their transport. Also, I don’t think we should be the ones that are responsible to finding out how much carbon emission each of our products is accounted for. This information should be provided by the manufacturing companies that make the product. I believe by adding this label will keep us on our edge with the climate crisis issue. Most people care about the calories label, but the carbon label should just be as important. The less packaging, the better. This is why bringing our own shopping bags will be a good way to start.

I believe reading this book had the most impact on my personal beliefs more than any other reading I have read for this class in the past has had on me. The biggest thing that has impacted me the most was the fact that this book was centered around the author’s journey to bettering his own carbon footprint and the methods he took in order to make that work. As mentioned in past comments, flying to me has been almost second nature, as my parents believed the best education came from real life experiences and experiencing cultures outside the bubble that is the United States. Now that I am older, I am beginning to realize the insane carbon footprint I’ve had in the past and how I need to do better to try and minimize my personal carbon footprint through travelling more sustainably and being consciously aware of every decision I am making when I decide to travel. Learning that almost everything has a carbon footprint that follows it was also somewhat terrifying, as I never realized that everyday products such as washers and dryers emitted an annual lump of carbon in itself. This was also one of my favorite readings because unlike the last one, these readings gave more of a relatable way to try and minimize my own carbon footprint.

Amy, this reading also had much more of a personal impact than previous readings. I feel as though this reading felt to be a lot more relatable, as Peter has a great way of communicating information about the climate crisis without seeming overly alarmist. He is also able to incorporate key statistics that show the severity of the issue, but focuses on how these amounts of emissions can be lowered through individual action. I think that this reading would be one that I would recommend to others as it is not too difficult to comprehend and gives a great analysis of the issue at hand as well as simple ways to act individually in order to combat it. As a frequent flyer, I also never saw flying as a big issue, and felt as though my other efforts to combat the climate crisis were enough. Now, however, I am seeing how much of my carbon footprint is due to flying, and other transportation that I have taken advantage of, such as driving my own car. Through this course, I have definitely become more conscious of the impact of my decisions that I would have otherwise not given much thought to.

While I think what he has done is remarkable, I do not think that changes on this scale are possible for everyday american. His position as a scientist means that he is able to make modifications to his car and electronics that many people simply don't have the knowledge to change. Additionally I am not sure if people are willing to make changes such as the poop in the back yard or are able to bike to work/school due to long commutes. 
   <br><br>
I love his overall message however, and have been looking into my everyday practices and consumption methods to see where I can reduce my impact. Two things I have done recently have been cutting my meat intake and trying to drive less. I have not calculated to what degree this impact has had but based on the examples presented in class i can only assume it is a lot.

A couple things that I really like from this week's readings by Peter Kalmus:
   <br><br>
I like that instead of trying to save the world, he's just trying to live a good life as intrinsic motivation and personal fulfillment have a much bigger role in changing our lifestyle compared to any external factors like money or praise. 
   <br><br>
I can totally relate with the cognitive dissonance that he talked about, that feeling of guilt and shame in knowingly disrupting our planet, following which he emphasizes the importance of aligning our personal actions with our values to rid ourselves of those negative feelings.
   <br><br>
On the Collective Action Chapter, I find the basic mechanism of a carbon fee quite straightforward, while the concepts of cap and trade or cap and auction are harder to grasp, at least for me. I wish there is like a tedx style video or some sort of illustration that would make them easier to understand and remember. I feel like the easier these policies are to understand, the easier it is to support them (or otherwise).

This last quarter I have begun to feel like my catholic relatives with all the self-loathing I had for the actions I commit on a daily basis, every bite of meat was accompanied by my inner monologue telling me  'that is equivalent to 30 pounds of lentils'.  
   <br><br>


I think that Peter summarizes it best with his philosophy of living your life mindful of the actions you take and their negative consequences and live your life free of the guilt that makes up modern life. 

   <br><br>

It is also important to support policy that can have a positive impact, more than the actions of our own personal consumption.



<br><Hr>
Gia, I took the same things away from this article. I thought his perspective on personal action was really interesting. If we look at our actions on a larger scale, we feel miniscule, like we don’t matter. However, we should focus on how cutting emissions and living a more sustainable lifestyle benefits us personally. I thought the way he put it, as being “connected with the land, food, and community” was beautiful. Although we should push for societal change and advocating sustainable living to our friends and family, I agree that we often forget to think how we can benefit, beyond just benefiting the planet. 
    <br><br>
Additionally, his perspective about quantifying our impact really resonated with me. This whole class has been focused on finding out the facts and figures behind food waste, travel, housing, and many more topics. The more I learn about the specific footprints that my actions are, the more I am able to put them in perspective with more sustainable options, ultimately making better choices for myself and the planet. I think this aligns with the message that Peter was trying to make in chapter one, that quantifying impact leads to deeper awareness. 
    <br><br>
I also agree about the economic side of cap and trade and carbon taxes. When trying to think about them on such a large scale, they can be hard to picture how it would actually work. This video helped me though, and it's an interesting proposal! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2Wvy9F_gA

Seeing Kalmus appear in the course's scheduled reading, rather than in the film assignment from last week, I was excited to see what else we could learn from him, and I took this week's reading in with welcoming arms. Reading about Kalmus's struggle with his perception of how much danger he puts the planet in, in combination with his justified attacking on large corporations who emit large amounts of carbon emissions into the atmosphere, was once again very entertaining. Not just entertaining, but informative as well. For example I did not know before about just how politicians persuaded the masses into believing that the climate crisis is not as dangerous as it is being painted. Acts from these politicians are disgusting, and it was definitely interesting to see how Kalmus reacted to them. There are so many things that I learned in this week's reading, and I am very glad that Ken assigned it to us.

Personally, I'm glad that Ken assigned this reading to us after we and watched the film. After watching "Being the Change," I wanted to know about the specific efforts that Peter was making to lower his emissions footprint as much as possible. But in terms of the corrupt politicians that have been denying this crisis for decades, I often liken it to the tobacco industry ~50 years ago. Large corporations in the industry lied directly to the people in an effort to defend their product and not lose profits. The same can be said for oil corporations and greedy politicians: they are denying the reality of climate change in an effort to defend not only their product, but their political agenda. It is great to see that people like Peter are working hard to expose these individuals for who they really are, while also doing whatever they can to minimize their impact on the planet. Personally, I liked the movie a bit more, since it gave us a visual and more personal account of how he and is family go about being sustainable, and I feel like that his closer to home for me.

After reading Peter Kalmus' Being the Change, not watching it this time, I have developed a renewed respect for his devout lifestyle changes. I find it inspiring that his motivation is not to solve the climate crisis all on his own, because he recognizes that one person's emissions really aren't the solution in the grand scheme. But morally, his argument makes sense, he knows the harms fossil fuels are causing so he decided that partaking in their consumption essentially squanders his knowledge like Ken so often expresses. This rationale for reducing fossil fuel dependence in turn makes me realize that I must too act on my knowledge of climate change to a certain extent at least. Simply continuing a heavily consumerist American way of life would be ignorant in my opinion, we all must TRY and at least cut back somewhere to do our parts personally. One thing I didn't really like from this reading however was that all of the facts were mainly given in units of kg instead of the direct unit of ton. Although this conversion is not so difficult, it still made me a bit confused in some places and I had a harder time resonating with some statistics, especially in the lecture video when Ken kept going back and forth the numbers just started getting jumbled in my head. My confusion made me think of some of the environmental communication tips we learned last week and how scientists often present work that is not explicit enough for the general public to care about enough. That being said however, his pie charts and data were still good to see that a normal suburban life is still obtainable without relying on too many fossil fuels.

I strongly agree with this comment. I really appreciate the effort and courage he had put into saving the climate by changing his lifestyles. Quoting from Ken, “Knowledge is wasted if we don’t put good use into it”. I am glad that he has the vision for the greater future and decides to act upon it by starting with himself. 
   <br><br>

Speaking of our personal actions for a better future and environment for the generations behind us, I want to draw an inference from one my favorite show The Good Place. In this universe, apparently one is judged not only by their direct consequences, but also the chains of effect of their actions. So if someone bought an iPhone which is made from a labor factory, they will score negative points that would keep them from going to “the Good Place”. I find this similar to the choices we make in respect to the planet. Even though i’m unsure if we have a system of judgement like that in the afterlife, it would quite be interesting to use this method to measure how we had positively / negatively impacted the planet / everyone else. For example, with the facts that buying a pound of beef indirectly causes a certain amount of CO2 pollution, buying a shirt wastes a certain amount of water, these can reduce your points, and planting trees are practicing recycling can earn you more points. How much do we score out based on our previous actions? Do we have a positive score or a negative score? If we say our lives in afterlife are judged by the score, would we still ignorantly keep rampaging our planet?

In reading Peter Kalmus’s “Leaving Fossil Fuel” chapter, I thought it was amazing how passionate he was in reducing his and his families personal footprint. However, I found it a bit difficult to relate or be able to do similarly as I 1. have no idea how to make those calculations for myself and 2. also have no idea how I would be able to change so many appliances out of my Isla Vista home. I feel bad that I can’t make these changes right now but it is not really that viable for me, and probably many other students as well. The only thing I feel as if I have true control over is my food choices, as I have been eating plant-based entirely for 5 years, I wonder what my carbon footprint would look like if I was eating anything and everything being that Kalmus mentioned that ⅓ of all emissions come from food production and half of that comes from livestock. It is easy to be conscious of the food choices we make right now. We live in Central California, not a small town in Arkansas.
   <br><br>


What I found astounding is that Peter modified his car to run on vegetable oil, eliminating 400 kg of CO2 per year. Though I know I can’t really do that because I have no idea how plus I know no one who does know how to do that, I can do my best to ride my bike as much as possible which is easy being that we live in IV and I don't really leave this bubble that much anyway.
   <br><br>


In reading the second chapter, “Collective Action,” I found that the idea of a carbon fee/tax/cap-and-trade would be extremely beneficial in incentivizing a push to create effective non-carbon energy sources though they have their own problems, they are still a step in the right direction. This also would force a lot of people to be inspired in finding new ways to get places or make better choices on what they spend their money on. Along with this, I found that his point of “a sustainable human civilization will require us to reorganize around an economic system that doesn’t depend on growth.” Though this is a weird concept for a lot of us since this is all we have known, I feel as if it is one of our only options. We have to change our mentality from monetary gain and economic growth to sustainable living and local abundance, after all, we made all these systems and concepts up anyway. The way we use our money and which theories we decide to build off of and follow is a touchy subject, and I’m not all that educated on the layers of economic theory, but what I do know is whatever we are doing now is not helping us out in the long-run.

Hey Claire, I also found it hard to do what Peter does on a daily basis. Having a job at JPL (NASA) shows that Peter is financially stable, but most Americans aren’t. Lots of people struggle to even find a job, let along pursuing a higher education. Recently, I kept coming across a meme that indicated the stupidity of taking out loans to go to school, then spending the rest of your life paying back that loan. I was able to connect to the true meaning before the mockery because I am pursuing a career in dentistry and financial aid is not a thing in professional schools. My tuition along will cost approximately $120,000 a year, possibly half a million dollars before I graduate dental school. If I plan to specialize in a specific field, then that’s another 2-3 years of schooling out of pocket. The financial burden for a typical student is way larger if we don’t have financial support from our family. With Peter being a scientist, he was able to calculate everything precisely and use his engineering skills to work the switching of diesel and vegetable oil in an automobile, I’m not so sure I carry the same skill set to do the same. 
<br><Hr>
I agree, his passion is great, but I also don’t know how to do these calculations or change my lifestyle when it’s sort of implemented in our current living situations. Our diets are something we have more freedom to change, but even to that extent it is hard to buy enough groceries and have a proper meal plan. The comparison of the train and the greyhound is interesting as the one time I attempted to get on the greyhound it was delayed for 3 hours and the area it drips you off at in my hometown is sketchy by night so while it emits less it would be at the cost of a late arrival and anxiety about being in a new area at night. It really takes a lot of passion and dedication to commit to certain lifestyles. The changes that he made that interest me the most are the food and car travel. The way he was able to make his car a tad better for the environment is impressive and a measure I would like to live up to.


<br><Hr>
Peter Kalmus is extremely passionate in what he does not only as a scientist, but as an individual in reducing his own carbon footprint as much as he possibly can. He also provides the public with multiple possibilities on how we can tremendously draw down our own greenhouse gas emissions in a very possible, simple, and sustainable way, such as he dramatically reduced his. I find Kalmus to be a very reliable person knowing that he followed his own solutions that he put out to the public, and wasn't just “all talk” and no action. At the end of chapter 14, “Collective Action,” Kalmus even mentions that the information that he presented to the public was in his “opinions as a human, not as a scientist,” representing how passionate he is about our climate crisis and how important it is for everyone to be aware and take personal action themselves. 
<br><Hr>
I definitely agree with your opinion about the reading and our actual situation. The chapter “Leaving Fossil Fuel” shows that Peter Kalmus reduces his emission from 20 to 2 metric tons of CO2 per year while continues living a normal suburban life with his family. Peter indicates that his five most effective actions were quitting planes, vegetarianism, bicycling, freeganism, and composting. I appreciate his effective actions and believe that I can switch to plant-based diet and reduce unnecessary car use. However, as an International student living in a Goleta apartment, I could neither quit planes nor do composting. Same as you, I feel that I only have true control of my food choice. Moreover, I found Peter’s idea that buying electric vehicles, rooftop solar panels, and other expensive equipment may become barriers to going further is reasonable. Instead of examining behaviors and changing themselves, shoppers reinforce a comfortable habit of consuming. Since average Americans spent 6000 dollars per year, roughly equals to 3 metric tons CO2 emissions, what we should do is restraining consumerism. Peter chose a no-cost, home-brewed path, changing his lifestyle, spending less, and opting out of consumerism.This part of his approach is practical for people with different level of income. Plus, I also feel that using vegetable oil for cars is admirable but not very doable for us.
<br><Hr>
I also found the ideas that Kalmus proposed were difficult to incorporate into our everyday lives. I did, however, see a lot of value in the numbers that he included with each action he took to reduce his climate impact -- it made it feel as if the changes Kalmus were making would actually have an impact on the world. I believe that was the point of including the numbers, not necessarily for everyone in the public to start calculating their carbon footprint per activity but to show that these actions have weight.

I actually liked the reading a lot more than the movie. I felt like these chapters were very accessible and easy to read. The facts that were presented about the CO2 emissions were astounding and surprising. The emphasis on the impact of flying was really important and made me reconsider the impact travel truly has. His data was surprising and the importance of quantitative facts were highlighted as I think a huge part of people and the climate change is the lack of facts. People don’t know how much their actions actually impact the environment. I didn’t even know all of the facts about which modes of transportation emitted the most CO2. I also found it really interesting how he discussed the people he knew who were vegans and huge proponents of sustainable food etc but they flew regularly which defeated their “sustainability.” It is crazy how one can work so hard to cut their emissions through food and energy etc but one flight can be equivalent to all of it. I also found the carbon fee to be a really good proposal for combatting the climate crisis. I didn’t know the difference between a tax and a fee and I found it to be a really good proposal about how to charge people for their carbon use, disincentivizing it, while also putting the money back into the community. I found it kind of unrealistic or hard to believe that someone could get $12,000 in returns but if it was feasible that would be great. I like how he made it a point that a carbon tax would just crush low income households but revenue neutrality would be able to keep them afloat and potentially help them too. I used to thik cap and trade sounded like a good policy because it was the most politically feasible but after reading this I now know all the flaws of cap and trade. I didn’t even know about the concept of a carbon fee and revenue neutrality. If British Columbia can implement it with success we should be able to too. The US lacks compared to the world in accomplishing anything and we need to work harder. The US unfortunately leads the world so without us championing the cause other countries aren’t motivated. It is a world issue and the world needs to unite over this, there are no other options left and it is truly angering watching other people work hard while we do nothing. I also really liked how this reading offered the individual impacts as well as collective action.

I also liked this reading much more than the movie. The movie, while interesting had parts I felt were not too informational just added to show more of his life and beliefs, like the meditation section of the movie. This, however seemed more objective and gave hard facts and numbers regarding his actions, which I thought was more helpful and easier to get a grasp on the actual effects of his actions. I think it is crucial to measure our actions quantitatively to notice how much each of our daily actions can harm the planet. 
   <br><br>


The section of the book about flying was interesting and I find it both interesting and frustrating that flying is so harmful to the environment. Just taking a few flights a year or even one can negate all of the other efforts one puts toward lowering their emissions for the year or even more. I am a vegetarian, and have been for most of my life, but I also fly a lot. This makes me wonder how much of an effect being vegetarian has, if it all, when taking into account all of the emissions I put out just by flying a few times a year. I am not vegetarian only for the environment, but I would like to think it makes some difference. 
   <br><br>


The carbon tax has always been of interest to me and I feel that this book explained it well and makes it seem that it could really work, although it is undoubtedly extremely complicated to implement and introduce into the economy. I particularly like the CFAD model and think this method could have a great affect.

Overall I really enjoyed this reading and seeing how each of his actions could be accounted for, making him feel more accountable and probably motivates him to see how little he can emit.

Peter highlights that people should move away from using fossil fuel. Moreover, he advocates that people should understand their climate impact before taking action. Basic quantification can help them know the biggest source that generates CO2. He mentions there are some aspects of life that produce lots of CO2 into the atmosphere. Air travel was the biggest part of Peter's CO2 footprint, and he decided to ramp down his air travel, and his CO2 footprint is reduced by a factor of 10. The second part is to reduce the usage of cars which dominate the biggest proportion of most Americans' CO2 footprint. Peter appeals that people can ride a bike if it is not a long-distance travel. In addition, Peter points out that methane is not "green fossil fuel", because it is a far more potent greenhouse gas than CO2. He also underscores the difference of CO2 emission between people who eat meat and vegetarian. Furthermore, saving electricity can reduce a lot of people's CO2 footprint. Most of these are also proposed by Ken, but peter utilizes many statistics to persuade people to reduce their CO2 footprint.
      <br><br>
  Additionally, Ken notes that Peter both focused on solving the climate crisis from personal approach and from collective action. Peter listed many experiences which he explored, and he believes that everyone else can also make it. For example, people can eat less meat which can reduce lots of CO2 emissions. Peter also strengthens the usefulness of activism. Furthermore, government regulation is necessary which is to impose carbon tax since people will not voluntarily move away from using fossil fuel. He thinks fossil fuel is a market failure, and only government regulation can deal with it.

I honestly feel like a Blue’s Clues character. The clue is right there, sitting in front of my eyes blatantly, but I am still stuck asking “Where’s the clue?” Everyone is yelling at the TV, at me, that the clue is obviously right there, but I’m still stuck asking myself the same questions. “How do I fix climate change?” “What can I do?”
   <br><br>
The reality is that I learn everyday what I can do. So why don’t I do it?
   <br><br>

In the book Being the Change, Peter Kalmus says “I… think that many people are addicted to flying. Even if they knew the impact of their choice to fly, I suspect many would continue doing so.” I think this is the issue many are facing today, myself included. We have become addicted to the lifestyles we lead. We have been raised in a consumerist culture and while we can see its flaws and the harm it does to our societies and our planet, we still struggle to separate ourselves from that consumerist culture. It’s like a bad habit that everyone has so you think it must not be that bad. You know you should change, but it’s hard because you can’t necessarily see any of its immediate effects on the planet. Flying, driving, meat, dairy, electricity, stuff: it all has been made to seem normal and even essential. It’s hard to be told that much of what you were raised on is wrong. It’s easy to be informed, but it’s a lot harder to actually take action on that information. The best example I can use for this is, once again, flying. Many people who might be aware of the harm they cause still use them, but it’s hard to give up something so addictive as flying. Getting to exotic, foreign destinations in a matter of a few hours (while also being up amongst the beautiful, suspended clouds) is not a bad gig. It’s amazing in fact, but its effects on the environment are the utter opposite. It’s so harmful, but many people are in denial, or simply don’t care, because they can’t see the direct impact of flying with their eyes, and also because they just couldn’t see themselves giving it up. Once you have access to something like that, it’s hard to give it up. Then, people are moving to these new places they travel to, but they leave behind loved ones so then they have to travel even more, back and forth, between the two. One of my favorite things that Kalmus discussed in his chapters was that he simply enjoyed living more when he was emitting less fossil fuels. He was able to build his “connection with the land, with food, with family and friends, and with community”. I think we should try to focus on more of these positive relationships that we gain rather than overthinking that which we might lose. I know I will try to make more efforts to take more actions that aligns with my principles, but flying is still an issue to me because I am addicted to flying. I have family abroad, and traveling already has spread my heart to even farther parts of the world. I love meeting new people with new ideas from around the world and seeing all the beautiful places that exist on this Earth. I think that to counter this, I am going to try to explore more of the places that are closer to me and build more of an appreciation for my local environment. I will use slow travel to get to places and try to build stronger relationships within my community. Peter says “We don’t need to get on airplanes to serve.” I think this applies to everything I get on airplanes to do. I can find those things in my immediate community and I will continue to try to do so.

I really liked this comment and the opening which honestly gave a pretty accurate description of how many of us must be feeling. I was also excited to see another assignment that had to do with Peter Kalmus--his movie was so inspiring and moving that I couldn’t wait to read the origin of that film in this book form. I agree and now understand that most of the decisions that we can make that would have the greatest impact are not things we can currently do as college students (live in a city, use renewable energy sources for our homes, etc.) But we can do many things like eating with the climate in mind--bringing it back to Ken’s description of what he does when eating out with others and describing his dietary choices as climate-arian rather than a flat out vegan (discouraging questions and conversation). I liked this reading as it was from the perspective of a real climate scientist and he had much to say but always backed it with good accurate facts. I hope to work towards the top five things that Peter did--quitting planes, vegetarianism, bicycles, freegan, and composting. I also like the mentioning of the clothesline and how much of an impact that can really make versus using a dryer. Overall this reading and the encouragement for the need for climate activism was very inspiring.

It is very easy to feel small in this world. The Earth is so big and there are so many countries and cities and people it feels like what you do doesn’t matter because you are so small compared to the rest of the world. Because of this, it often feels like our individual actions couldn’t possibly have a real effect on the world. Because of this common mindset, Kalmus’ work is so important because it provides so much evidence and so many facts that make you feel like your choices matter. He also goes on to list what he feels are the most effective actions that can be taken which include stop riding airplanes, biking, changing your eating habits and composting. Having a plan and goals based off of known statistics can be very comforting and make the transition to change much easier. 
    <br><br>

 From this reading, though facts are extremely useful I primarily learned that you cannot face the climate crisis with facts alone. Along with the intellectual side being of great importance, what is also extremely important is compassion and a strong narrative. With so many misconceptions about the actual nature of our current climate crisis, it is very simple to hear facts and statistics and think very little of them. Most often, these facts and figures will go in one ear and out the other; they are not impactful. What is impactful is hearing someone's voice and knowing that there are real faces and real names behind these statistics. If we are going to change the way people think and provoke people to be the change needed in the world, we cannot expect to persuade people with impersonal numbers and facts, we need to make it raw, real, and relatable. This reading really helped me see that kindness and thoughtfulness must be taken into account when trying to change the world.

Peter Kalmus has a very realistic approach to promoting policy that he thinks will pass, not just policy that sounds the best. In discussing the benefits of a carbon fee versus a carbon tax, he is keeping the environment the top priority by backing legislation that is likely to be implemented faster because of its bipartisan nature. Kalmus mentioned that some environmentalists don't like the idea of a carbon fee simply because it is the policy preferred by big oil. I find this to be a very harmful way of thinking. One of my biggest frustrations as a voter is that strong environmentalist lawmakers like Bernie Sanders and his voter base have positive progressive ideas that may never be implemented because they don't take conservatives into account. Us versus them is a great method for rallying your supporters, but is a horrible way to get policy passed; and every year we maintain that mentality is another year with no policy being implemented. 
   <br><br>
I also found it somewhat funny that as I'm reading about the effects of nature on the economy and the importance of switching to a renewable energy infrastructure, the stock market is suffering its biggest scare in over a decade because of two threats. One, an effect of nature (coronavirus), and two, the major drawback of a major dependence on foreign oil. Currently, Saudi Arabia is attempting to recapture market share against Russia by flooding the market with crude oil. Oil prices crashed 34% in the United States due to the will of another nation, and some are saying that the 11-year bull market is now a thing of the past. In a world where the United States was operating on renewable energy, this wouldn't be an issue.

I think it’s interesting to see a climate scientist follow the advice he gives others, and I think it was important for him to “present [his] opinions as a human” because that makes him more relatable and someone that we can trust. Peter Kalmus’s personal actions to fight climate change are mostly very practical, and not difficult for the average person to carry out. After he altered his ways in favor of a more environmentally-friendly lifestyle, his life did not change drastically - at least in my opinion - and that inspires me to make similar changes. However, some of his suggestions are hard for the common person to adopt into their lifestyle. He mentions his car that runs with vegetable oil, and although I like that it means that a person can still have a car that does not harm the environment, it is also not doable by someone who has to get to far places or can not afford to be late, because, as Kalmus mentions, the car is unpredictable. Still, things like reducing food waste and biking to nearby places are within everyone’s capabilities and should be done.
   <br><br>


I liked that Kramus was optimistic about his own contributions to fighting climate change, but he also acknowledged that actions on a larger scale were needed. The idea of a carbon fee and dividend is very appealing, and the fact that British Colombia has already tried it and has not faced any negative consequences makes it all the more likable. Other suggestions by Peter would be very beneficial if only people were willing to carry them out. He mentions bipartisan support as well as global cooperation but with people caring about other things like the economy, it is highly unlikely those will happen in the near future. The half-Earth idea is a little extreme, especially since the human population continues to grow. The redistribution of wealth is something I would back completely, but something I know would probably never happen. More reasonable ideas, though, include getting money out of politics and stabilizing the population, and we can all make that happen by voting and educating others.

I definitely agree with your comment. After reading how Peter assessed his carbon emissions, reduced them, and ultimately maintained (or increased in his case) his quality of life, I am very motivated to implement as many changes as I can into my own life. Peter outlined many things that through this course I have learned contribute way more to our carbon footprints than I ever would have thought, such as flying or food waste. One thing that did surprise me was learning that his usage of a MacBook Air, which is the computer I use on a daily basis, contributes 140 kg of CO2e per year. While I may sound naive, I had no idea that simply using my computer emitted CO2 into the air, only further increasing my annual carbon footprint. I really do believe that these changes are relatively easy and reasonable to implement into the average American lifestyle. It may seem difficult, but if not for the planet, we have seen that we can become happier, healthier, and enjoy life a bit more. While most importantly, fixing the problem we contributed the most too. I agree in saying that Peter did suggest some ideas of collective action that I also deem impossible for us, but he also offered ones very obtainable in the near future. We can make major impacts by simply voting in those who will make the policy to do so. Bringing in the example of British Columbia provides evidence that a life we are striving for is possible, and we can still thrive. I just feel like we have to do something, and we need to collectively stop denying what is right in front of us.

To be honest, fossil fuels is one of the most important natural resource for human. But it has caused great problems with our planet. Human has exploit to much fossil fuels to produce other necessities. But it also is the main source of green house gas. Although, some countries has employed carbon tax to limit the use of fossil fuels, the environment still need lots of efforts. Fossil fuels always associate with profits of different companies. How we can balance the environment and profits, because some politicians and business man only care about how much profits they can earn at her than the damage of environment. I think if people an come our a idea that can balance the profits and damage of environment, it will be very helpful to our environment.

I feel you. As the world develops, we need more fossil fuels than before. It is really hard to balance between the use of fossil fuels and climate environment. It is impossible to give up using all fossil fuels. We need time to change our ways of using fossil fuels. For instance, we can use more clean energy like wind power and solar energy. Many companies in the world are experiencing the pressure of changing in resources uses. Some of them do not know how to do with solar energy and other clean energy as their governments have no experience about this. Other companies avoid using cleaner energy simply because of the cost of it. Profits and power seem more important to businessmen. Corruption among officials is happening everywhere in the world. It influences our rights of having clean waters and sky. What’s more, exploiting too much natural resources will cause the scarce in the world. Wars will also happen for competition among humankind.

In this week’s reading Peter Kalmus discusses the topics he showed in his film, “Being the Change.” He elaborates on the easy lifestyle changes that individuals can make to resolve issues humans have created through excessive carbon emissions that have contributed to the global climate crisis. He explains why we should lower our air travel miles, car usage, food waste, and electricity usage. Kalmus explains how changing these small everyday tasks and reducing his fossil fuel usage has made him and his family happier people. They feel healthier and enjoy the rewarding feeling of knowing they are helping the earth and have a purpose. I found this extremely motivating to make changes in my own life with confidence that it will make a difference in the world. I can also agree with the fact that going vegetarian is extremely rewarding to yourself and the environment since I have been vegetarian for half of a year now. I genuinely feel like I have more energy, sleep better, and can control my weight much easier. Some of these changes might be more difficult than others but we should not be discouraged because some change and even gradual change is infinitely greater than no change at all.

I have also recently switched to a vegetarian diet and found that I feel more in control of what my body looks and feels like. It's amazing. I've cut back on getting catching ubers everywhere and have stuck to riding my bike, catching the bus, and taking the amtrak when I need to go back home. I have never felt more in control of my well-being and happiness knowing that I am making a difference. With that being said, I think Kalmus' belief that we need to change ourselves before anything else is one of the most important pieces of advice anyone can give not only about climate change, but about life. The phrase "Be the change you want to see in the world" is expressed so many times, but not everyone can live up to it.


<br><Hr>
I agree that the rewards of being vegetarian are very notable. There are personal, environmental, and psychological rewards. I am personally not completely vegetarian or vegan but lately I have been consuming less meat and more plant based products like soy milk and I can say that I do genuinely see a difference in my body and levels of energy. Although I can not directly see a difference in the environmental impacts of me eating less animal products, if everyone started to do so I think we would see a very large difference. So why aren't people doing this too? I think that people are selfish and greedy and think that they "deserve" to eat meat like it is one of their rights. It would be so easy to go away from this notion of eating meat to just being vegetarians.

The readings by Peter Kalmus, were defiantly some of the most inspiring we have read this quarter. Rather than just talking about the statistics and problems we have, Kalmus gave us insight on his own personal journey of transitioning to a more environmentally friendly lifestyle. Ironically the benefits did not just revolve around benefiting his own environment but his own happiness and well being as well. He describes that his reasonings had little to do with the environment the main three being, the enjoyment of living with less fossil fuel, aligning actions with principles, and shifting culture through personal reduction. He describes how by living with less fossil fuel, things like growing your own food or using cars less, can connect you more to the land, family and friends around you. And that in addition to this, you no longer have to feel guilty for doing things that may be in the best interest of yourself but harmful to others, strengthening your morals and "walking the walk" rather than just "talking the talk". He also describes how a single personal really can create a change as the domino effect can occur, once one person begins to transition into making more environmentally friendly lifestyle choices they may influence others to do so as well. He describes how the personal scale and are scale of improving the state of the climate crisis are connected, and that one can truly not work without the other. By describing the simple solutions he found to reducing his own carbon footprint, and touching on the pathos of the reader, he connects with the audience, and shows the possibilities we have to make these changes as well.
   <br><br>
This reading I felt was the most applicable and the best at connecting to us as students, who are now, and in the near future deciding the lifestyles we want to live as adults, the companies and sources we want to consume and invest in, and how we will affect the climate crisis epidemic.

Malenalo!!! As I was scrolling through the comments sections for this week's reading, I was so happy to see your comment. I agree with a lot of what you had to say about the reading for this week my lovely pal! It was so inspiring to read about Kalmus and how he changed his personal lifestyle for the sake of climate justice. I find that people often credit their ambivalence regarding the climate crisis to the lack of immense impact that comes from individually made changes. However, as you have described, one person choosing to make personal changes in their life can have a vast affect on those around them, whether or not they are actively trying to encourage a similar lifestyle for friends and family. I think that it is critical that more people engage in an environmentally motivated lifestyle, but I also think that it is necessary that it’s not forced upon anyone, as this will isolate those who are most critical to convince to make changes. I am certain that the newest generation of adults are the most progressive yet and I feel that we will make a positive impact, leading by example and fighting valiantly against ambivalence and ignorance.

Hello my loves! I felt very similarly to the both of you. This reading definitely gave me hope that through individual action, a lot can get done. I prefered the reading a lot more to the movie “Being the Change”, as the poor editing and sometimes cringey scenes made it hard to watch and take in what it was all about. On the other hand, the reading was a lot easier to digest, and demonstrated how personal action can inspire others. As you mentioned Malenalo, one person’s action can create a domino effect, where one’s actions can eventually lead to people shifting their views, creating positive change. I also loved the part where he talked about how, ironically, his motivation for his lifestyle isn’t necessarily saving the environment, but rather is just an added bonus, or benefit to his simple lifestyle. He describes his driving force to be his own happiness, along with his family’s. This part of the reading created a parallel with the movie “Happy”, where we witnessed the happiest people being the ones most connected with nature, free of financial motivation and success, and rather full of personal fulfillment. This is very inspiring and makes me hopeful that more people will start adopting such a lifestyle. Although it may be difficult to completely switch to his lifestyle 100%, I believe parts of it are very attainable and feasible. It could also be motivating to others, who may not have the environment in mind, to adopt some of these changes, for the sake of saving money. As Kalmus discussed, a large amount of our personal footprint comes from waste, such as leaving lights on, leaving the water running, and food waste. Cutting out this waste is not only essential for the wellbeing of our planet, but it will also help people save money, making things more realistic and achievable.

Hello Clealo!!!! I will truly miss being in this class, watching the films, and discussing new knowledge with you! What you said is so true, the knowledge is in our hands, consequently so is the power. The panic epidemic we are going through now is one of the first of many we will have if our generation does not take this crisis into their own hands. We will constantly have natural disasters, disease, market crashes, and uncertain living situations if people do not wake up to do something about it! It truly starts with the individual, and I believe we personally have done a good job implementing changes into our lives, such as thrifting, eating less beef, drinking almond milk lattes ;) in order to benefit the environment, and hopefully our generation follows the same path. We have the chance to do something or stand by, this is our opportunity to rebuild society with the environment in mind.

The two chapters from Peter Kalmus’s book gave us many ways of reducing our carbon footprint; some of which I was not aware of before reading the book. Peter Kalmus also mentioned changes on a wider scale in addition to actions individuals can take. Some of such changes include incorporating carbon taxes, reducing reliances on fossil fuel, and redistributing wealth. I fully support Kalmus's effort in reducing his own carbon footprint; we could also use some of his ideas and actions to lower our carbon footprint too.

I agree with you saying that the book gave individual's ideas on how to reduce their personal carbon footprint. Personally, I think that reading these two chapters of the book were a good complement to the movie that we had to watch last week. I feel that although these two chapters talked about basically the same thing as the movie showed us, they definitely went more in depth and were more useful if someone is planning to take these actions seriously to reduce their emissions. Something that I do not recall from the movie was him mentioning the carbon tax. Personally, I am all for the carbon tax because I think that it is a very good way to reduce everyone's emissions as a whole, specially corporations. I feel like Peter Kalmus did a very good job at explaining what the carbon tax is about and how it would work. Something that I had not heard before about the carbon tax is how that money would be given back to the citizens of the country if it was a fee and not a tax. For me, this is something that sounds really appealing because it would give me the chance to receive extra money while doing something good for our environment. I can only see this as a win-win situation. Overall, I would say that I really enjoyed this week's reading.


<br><hr>
I feel like the two chapters were the same as the movie, the only difference was that there is more statistics and data given of course. The amount of statistics given in the reading can be quite overwhelming and readers may even begin to lose interest.  You can tell that Peter is genuinely happy with the decision he has made to help reduce his carbon footprint, he states that the reason why he does it is because he knows that by driving a car, using a washing machine, and throwing away food harms the planet. In the reading Peter tells us that in order to reduce the amount of CO2 we emit we have to reduce air travel, car travel, electricity, food, and simply stuff. In previous readings, lectures, and films we have learned this so it is a bit repetitive of Ken to make us read the same thing twice. Peter and his family live an ordinary life even drive a car however the only difference is that they are more conscious about how much CO2 they emit; Peter and his family is a great example that we can all lower our carbon footprint.

Personally, I was more affected by the documentary than the reading even though they stemmed from the same intentions/person. I think the overwhelming amount of statistics in the reading was hard to follow and hard to visualize compared to the movie. Although, I still think his point is still the same and his passion still remains. I liked that he acknowledges that a lot of his methods can be seen as extreme and impossible initially. Generally, the shift from everyday life to life like the one that Peter exhibits is going to be challenging and unattractive. But, in acknowledging that his lifestyle is one of the more extreme types, he gives people the option to gradually transition into the way he is living. It's a comforting thing to know that Peter is also aware that it may be hard to transition into a lifestyle so drastic as his. Because of this, Peter also gives a lot of advice in how everyone at home can slowly reduce their emissions just like how he did when he was first starting out.

It seems interesting to read about the author's lifestyle, how he reduces his emission through many components, traveling, working, eating habits...Once interesting fact I learn is that vegetable burning oil causes no net release of CO2, I’ve never heard of vegetable oil for car before. Another information I learned is the carbon fee. It’s different from the carbon tax, that it gives money back to citizens after the carbon price increases. It is favor by my Republicans, which is important to make more changes, and progress to deal with climate change, as we get people on both sides both to agree on a policy.

Fossil fuels have indeed played an important role in creating the high standards of life we have today, and they will certainly play a role in our future. But the issue of developing sustainable fuels for the future cannot be ignored. Just as coal replaces firewood and gasoline replaces a lot of coal, if we continue to work, one day gasoline will also be replaced by some better fuel. Right now when we refuel, we are glad to see the price of oil drop, but don’t forget that gasoline prices and supply shortages will happen. It is time for research, innovation and long-term consideration. Tomorrow's energy should not be all fossil fuels, nor should it be all renewable energy. It should be a combination of the two, coupled with new technologies, making it both economical and sustainable.

As mentioned by Peter Kalmus, as one of five of the most effective ways to reduce a personal carbon footprint, bicycling instead of owning a car is an extremely efficient way to cut out a large percentage of fossil fuels in your everyday life.  I recently leaned how to ride a bike to get around campus since the start of this course.  At first I was satisfied with walking everywhere, to class, to the library, to the dining commons, etc.  However, one quarter and 8 wreaks later, I realized I was more tired than productive by walking miles upon miles in a day to get the bare minimum done.  Walking isn’t bad for the environment by any means, but neither is biking and it’s by far a lot more efficient.  This one simple change in my everyday lifestyle has left me motivated to make more changes that will result in environmental gains and reductions in my personal carbon footprint.

After reading this week’s readings, “Leaving Fossil Fuel” and “Being the Change”. Both of the text showcases what I have been learning throughout this course in terms of carbon emission. Notably, “Leaving Fossil Fuel '' explains how changing your lifestyle by reducing carbon emission invokes certain changes to the individual and environment. Although it may be true that an individual’s reduction of carbon emission does not make dramatic changes to the world. It definitely affects an individual’s perspective and values. For instance, I agree to the author’s approach that by aligning your carbon emission reductionism to your actions, you are eventually burning the ‘cognitive dissonance’ which can often lead to depression and guilt. Thus, climate crisis action strengthens your discipline and core values. However, this concept could be different to another individual due to their customs and beliefs. Hence, “Some actions are bigger than others' . In another text, “Being the Change'' correlates to “Leaving Fossil Fuel” in a way that it introduces a new approach on how to deal with the climate crisis. The text exposes how both treaties ‘Kyoto Protocol’ and ‘Paris Agreement of 2015’ have failed the environment in enforcing ‘real actions’ towards the climate crisis. Although it may be also true that both treaties provided a starting point or a foundation on where society should start on reducing their carbon emission, the text highlights how loose both of the treaties are in maintaining and enforcing these actions due to the lack of political involvement, budget, and skepticism. As a result, the text introduces a new idea of carbon fee and dividend, which I found really interesting because we have not thoroughly delved into this concept throughout the course. Personally, I found this idea of fee to be more effective than the idea of tax because it's easier to get it pass through the law and enforcing this ‘fee’ would also increase productivity and human capital in a society.

I found what you mentioned in your response to be completely accurate, and the points you mentioned were very prevalent parts of the reading material. From watching Peter Kalmus' film last quarter, I developed this admiration for his lifestyle and I respected his devotion to personal change to better the environment. That being said, I was interested to see how his perspective would sound on paper, in which I believe Kalmus does a great job in making the material understandable and intriguing for the reader. As you mentioned, "Leaving Fossil Fuel" had some great points mentioned throughout the chapter, but one of the most captivating was the discussion of how leaving a fossil fuel dependent lifestyle could make you happier in the long run. When I think of changing my life for the better of the environment, I always envisioned the main benefit to be for the climate, not for my own mental state. However, this of course, makes complete sense when considering the American lifestyle and our dependency on material goods which in turn translate to our own personal status. We as society believe that owning more (the bigger the better) makes us look more successful to others which can be extremely detrimental to our own mental state because it seems as though nothing we obtain is ever enough compared to the idealized American lifestyle (such as the Kardashian lifestyle). Thus imagine if we all lived like Peter, and placed value in living life for the benefit of ourselves and the planet while disregarding our social status. I believe everyone would find comfort in this new lifestyle and society could change for the better to encourage a more green style of living.

On a separate note, the text "Being the Change" focused more on the political aspect of the climate crisis rather than the personal aspect which was discussed in his previous chapters. The Carbon fee and dividend that you talked about, also highly interested me. I had never heard of a "carbon fee" considering that this course had just discussed the "carbon tax", however I found the carbon fee to be a lot more realistic. Humans, especially Americans, want to see political action benefit them to some degree, thus a carbon fee, in which money will be distributed back to the consumer is a great way to integrate climate activism into law. The example of British Columbia proves that a CFAD would work and furthermore would do a great job of reducing carbon emissions on the corporate scale. From this knowledge it is our duty as educated American citizens to lobby and encourage our local politicians to support the creation of a CFAD in the hopes that the US can begin taking some small steps to halt global warming. Hopefully a CFAD is in the future of American politics so more extreme legislation (such as the Green New Deal) can be passed in the upcoming years.

I can’t agree with you more. I appreciate that you bring out the idea of how individuals change their perspectives and concepts by making actions people think are not that influential but actually demonstrate plenty of unknown thoughts people have not yet had. In addition, I like how you talked about the use of carbon fee. Despite the feasibility of imposing a carbon fee on the reduction of carbon emission, the political and cultural involvement can just lead to a united and organized opinion. Moreover, there’s already an example that British Columbia has executed the plan and prepared to do it. This brings to an optimistic point of view that it is a starting point for all of us, especially Americans, to follow their steps and further improve our planet with effective means, rather than pursuing huge assets or houses, money or benefits just to make yourself happy. Bear the selfishness one can be different in a positive way.

Being the Change by Peter Kalmus describes his daily lifestyle changes in depth and how he was able to reduce his personal emissions by a significant amount. While he states that reducing personal emissions alone would be “like trying to save the world all by myself” he also goes on about how having the knowledge and doing nothing about it is even more hypocritical. Kalmus revives a memory I had of taking an Ecological Footprint calculator quiz for an environmental science class. Before taking this quiz, I felt I was already living an eco-friendly life but the results of this test proved me wrong. According to my results, if everyone on Earth lived as I did, it would take 2 Earths to provide enough resources to sustain my specific way of life. I discovered that 23% of my impact is food related and 31.5% of my total impact is mobility related, similar to Kalmus. These statistics are frightening because not everyone lives with the same “eco-friendly” views as others while it may take 2 Earths to sustain myself, it may take 6 for someone who is not as environmentally conscious. We can start with simple gestures such as cutting down on eating meat, switching to public transportation, recycling, reusing items, and spreading knowledge to others who are unaware of the negative impact we are having on earth as Kalmus also suggests.

I completely agree with your comment. Although peter Kalmus points out that reducing personal emissions alone would be like “trying to save the world yourself”, the only way to change the world is to change yourself first. Like Ken has said in previous videos, knowledge is only power when action comes with it. Moreover, despite the fact that I have never done the ecological footprint calculator that you mention in your comment, I know that my lifestyle far exceeds the world average. Because of this, I can't help but feel hypocritical. I am well aware of the dangers climate change poses to our future yet I still honestly haven't considered eating less meat. 
   <br><br>

Next year, when I am no longer reliant on the dining halls for food, I plan on wasting as little food as possible, using public transportation more, and starting a compost bin. Like you said, small gestures to reduce your climate footprint are better than no gestures.

Despite being a little long, the chapters by Peter Kalmus had me wanting to finish the readings till the end. Like Ken said not only does he address issues, but he provides how to solve them which is what we learned we should do last week (when talking about climate crisis we should provide a solution to not make others feel hopeless). After reading both chapters I had two full pages full of notes that I actually find important! The crazy statistics he presented in his text had me really upset because of how dumbfounded they had me! For instance, the average american spends $6000 on stuff and his family and him only spend $4000. Another number that had me really upset was that our trash emits more CO2 than the average person in Bangladesh.... I liked that he included in his text statements against the wealthy and the IMF, World Bank, WTO that only destroy and care about money. Kalmus presents that how do we live in a world where the 62 billionaires have more money than 3.6 billion people. Like he states, we need to rethink wealth and power and how those who are rich only get richer and those who are poor only get poorer. On the topic of World Bank, WTO, and IMF they only care about corporations and disrupting the way third world nations function by implementing things like SAPs when they should care about the people!

I felt the same way and I loved the facts you decided to mention because they really show how important this reading is! I still can't believe that the comparisons to Bangladesh keep amazing me; I really thought I had heard it all but I hadn't. Looking at the fact that ONE person's TRASH generates more CO2 than the average person in Bangladesh (one person in everything they do, ONE) is wild!! These facts need to be broadcasted; they should appear on billboards, commercials, and ads. It really makes you think of your own contribution to the statement and to the statistic and it forces you to see the truth. I am looking back at how many times I throw away a trash bag in a week and I feel horror in realizing how wasteful I am being, especially in food, because it really is 3 times a week.  That goes perfectly hand in hand with how much I am wasting and the statistic you put; I again fall under that statistic that an average American spells 6,000 on stuff. It might not be that exact high number (because I only make so much right now as part-time) but I definitely spend on material things more than anything. I honestly understand how significant it is for these facts to be repeated over and over again because it really gets to you eventually. I become more and more real and these facts just build up in your head. It raises the desire to change, especially from the grip money has on this planet!!

In the reading the author Peter Kalmus talks about the everyday and straightforward tasks that us can do to mitigate the greenhouse emission. Such little detail will often be ignored by us in daily life, but by reading his book, I gained a new perspective. For instance, he changes to use a clothesline rather than manufacture of a clothes dryer; it could simply reduce 550kg of CO2 emission. In addition, as a climate scientist, Kalmus uses many data to illustrate his point. For instance, he points out that US landfills emit about 1,300 kg CO2 per person per year, such data gives the reader a more real feeling about the problems we are facing right now. Kalmus also focus on the personal action we could do as an individual. It seems to be a crisis won’t stop until the big corporation stops harming the climate for their own sake. However, personal action should not stop because it can still make changes. For instance, changing diet, buying less, taking fewer planes, downsizing will all help our climate.

Peter Kalmus " Being the Change" was a truly eye-opening reading. Most of us like talking about change but fail to realize we are part of the problem too. The author does incredibly well in being self-reflective and acknowledging the changes he must make to better serve the planet. Much like other readings, this one hits home. I must say I continue to be astonished by the statistics given. What is the worst part of the story is that I keep on telling myself that I am going to be more simplistic but I choose not to. This is what truly scares me looking into the future. Our society is too focused on consumerism and does not care about anything related to planet earth. The best people like me who are just selfish can do is vote. Voting is the most important we can do if we are too stubborn to change our consumerist habits.

I agree with the point you make in your comment.  The reading, "Being the Change" was very interesting to me.  Peter Kalmus offered various ways in which he has found to cut one's carbon footprint.  I appreciated the fact that Kalmus points out that individual effort is very important in resolving the climate crisis.  Many people feel like their individual actions will not impact the overall issue occurring in today's society.  Kalmus argues against this reasoning because each individual person can make a big difference in the way we choose to be wasteful in our daily lives.  Taking accountability for our actions is important and to realize that each of us makes a difference will become a collective effort to solve the climate crisis.

I totally agree with the author’s opinion that a person’s effort was like a tiny drip into the ocean, and it cannot have much impact on the planet. However, we still need to make an effort to protect the earth and call others to take action to protect the earth. First, we need to think about in our own lives, which causes emit CO2 the most. As an international student, I have to go back home by plane. But I can choose to stay in the US and go to somewhere near college, or somewhere I can get there by train during the spring break instead of coming back to China. Although this action just reduces once I take the flights, it still decreases the number that I emitted by plane as total. Also, I can talk to my parents that during the vacation, we can go to other places by train if we want to spend our vacation in other provinces. Before I take this course, I often choose to go to another country during vacation since the flight ticket is inexpensive, also it’s fast than other transportation. The second thing I can do is consume less. As the author says, each dollar spent on new stuff represents roughly 0.5 kg embodies CO2e emissions. I can think about the stuff that I want to buy are useful or useless to me. Sometimes people just think the stuff is really cheap than before, so I must buy it. But when they buy it, they just use like once or twice, and throw it away. We can live better even we don’t buy more clothes, cars, or houses. 
   <br><br>
All in all, we must think first about our daily emissions, then take action to reduce the emission, not just follow actions that experts give it to us.

I think the idea that Peter Kalamus, a highly educated climate scientist, advocates for lifestyle change as opposed to change from technology highlights the large impact, we can make by making simple changes. His avocation for a shift in American consumerism also highlights how destructive our lives are for our planet. Personal change is something that we can start now. Technological developments will definitely play an important role as well, but they are time burdened and may not be able to be implemented right away. While we may not immediately see the effects from altering our daily lives, the cumulative result will be very impactful. If we start now, the impact will be much greater than waiting for new technology in the future.
    <br><br>

I also really enjoyed these two chapters because he not only outlines the newscast steps we should be taking; he provides a detailed analysis of his experience making these changes. His experience with using less ultimately made his life more fulfilling. He repeatedly notes the happiness he has gained by making these pretty big changes. I think one of the main reasons people are reluctant to make such massive changes is fear. We have become very comfortable living in high luxury. Many of us have not experienced anything different. Kalamus’ experience affirms that there is nothing to fear. He expresses that is actually a lifestyle people should strive to inhabit as it simplifies life and makes people happier. After reading this, I am inspired to try to make small changes. Everybody strives to create more happiness in their lives, so if we can do that and also protect our environment, it is a win-win situation.

Yes, I agree. The quantitative result is more effective for people. Rationally, environment protectors like Engl 23 students  may support and truly want to reduce their own CO2 emission. However, emotionally, it is still hard against human nature which meat, big hoursing is attracting. The data of how exactly the CO2 emission they can reduce by the changing of behavior will motivate them a lot. People always like something with positive feedback immediately, such as the video games. The data is similar to the prize or gold in the game for people.
    <br><br>

When people satisfy the physical material desire, they are always looking for something virtually and metaphysically to improve their happiness. If people believe they are saving the earth and consider reducing CO2 emission is similar to the assignment in the game, the environment protecting life style will exponentially increase. Furthermore, if reducing more CO2 becomes the social capital like money and power, the environment may be saved. Now, our mission is to make a story for CO2 reduction similar to Diamond and Amway and sell it to the world. However, it is hard, because the people who has this ability are all working in Wall Street Now.

Honestly, yeah, it was really great how Kalmus not only said "here's what outcomes we calculated", but he also showed his work - letting everybody figure out the best way for themselves to reduce their carbon footprint for the least cost.

Here’s a valuable skill Peter has taught me that everyone needs to adopt: we need to keep score. Every single human needs to be accountable. Of course, with this comes mindful action and holistic change that will result in true sustainable lifestyles, but bare minimum, people should be aware of the damage they are inflicting. The first step to making conscious decisions is to know where one might be going wrong. Physically seeing the change that is being made can be the best motivation, and a great way to generate collective action. 
    <br><br>

Here are some things that these readings have made me want to start doing as acts of personal awareness: Starting by noticing how much less you might be able to spend on new stuff per year; Small efforts to reuse items and buying overall less. Then perhaps bigger travel efforts… Why are there not adult carpools to get to work in the morning? That could absolutely work as it does in younger life with school. I am interested in moving somewhere with better transportation for the public, I hate spending money on gas and am constantly frustrated by the barrier that car travel has on reducing my carbon footprint. And the discussion of clotheslines… I never want to dry my clothes anyways as it reduces their lifespan!! These are simple changes I see within my reach, other than the more commonly discussed, often-broad topics. I am going to reread these chapters again, and perhaps the entire book. This is content I want to show my family and spread awareness about.

I totally agree with you in terms of "keeping score" and thinking deeply about how our actions impact the world. I am lucky because growing up my parents really talked to me about the environment and the beauty of our Earth and universe in general. They bred in me this sense of thankfulness and wonder, I always felt that we were so lucky to be living where we are, amongst all these wonderful beauty and diversity, from our fellow human to every other animal, life and nature itself. 
   <br><br>

As a result, I have always kept a mental score in my head. Whenever I take an action, I always ask myself, what would happen if everyone acted they way you are just about to? If the answer seems negative, then I try my very best to not follow through with that action. This is the kind of thinking Peter Kalmus is advocating for, and this is the kind of thinking humans in general need to have in approaching their daily lives in a morally apt way. I feel like most people do the opposite though - they excuse their actions by saying that it's "just them, it's just this small thing, even if it's bad it couldn't hurt anyone - it's okay".  This is toxic thinking, this is what causes all the bad and harm in the world.
   <br><br>

I am an optimist though, recently I read this book called "the better angels of our nature" by Steven Pinker, where he talks about how and why violence has dramatically declined through the ages. I think our better nature is prevailing, but it's happening slowly, too slow for comfort especially when it comes to fighting the climate crisis.

It feels good to know that you also got that sense of accountability from his work. I also learned the importance of holding everyone accountable and how that can have multiple benefits. Of course there are some things we can’t control in the making of our products like the treatment of the workers, but we can control if we buy it or not. We have to hold everyone accountable in their actions and in what we buy. This can help lead us to more sustainable options. 
   <br><br>

I thought that the claims being made about recycling was interesting to say the least. They talked about how the Industrial Society fetishizes recycling. At first I wasn’t so sure about that but I got more convinced the more I read. Recycling allows us to be wasteful and even feel good in a sense that we are throwing something away to a better place than where it would go normally. And then we can go on consuming more. It brought up the idea of recycling being garbage 2.0 and I like that because it’s so true. Recycling has clouded our awareness of the impacts of our consumption to an extent so we need to continue to check ourselves. We need to reduce what we waste in all aspects. It’s crazy that the average person's waste here in the U.S. has more CO2 emissions than the average person in Bangladesh. Our trash has more impact than a person, that’s extremely pathetical to say the least, among many other things. The U.S. really has large systematic, moral, and behavioral changes that need to be made. I just hope we can make them in time before it’s too late.

Bella, I agree with you.  We have to start paying more attention to our personal actions.  This book influenced me and made me look at things differently.  It's so easy to just ignore the problems we are personally causing, but so important to do the opposite of that and address them.  We have to look at our lives and see what we can realistically do to make changes in our lives towards the better.  Listen, I understand it may not be realistic or even possible for everyone to adapt an entirely plant based diet, or to stop traveling, etc. But, we must do what we can.  Limit your animal product intake at the very least, when you can.  Take the slow travel option when possible.  Do the things that are reasonable. We need to stop just making general excuses for ourselves.  

   <br><br>

One thing that I suggest specifically for you, you say that you would like to move somewhere with better options for public transportation, and to you I say this:  don't move to somewhere more eco-friendly, instead try and make changes where you already are.  Because in reality, the bus in the eco-friendly city you may be looking to, is already gonna run.   When you move, someone is going to move into SB, and start driving everywhere, replacing your footprint.  Instead, advocate for better public transportation here.  It's definitely something that I believe to be doable here in Santa Barbara, and a movement I have a feeling a fair amount of people would get behind.  We need personal changes, but we also need bigger, societal ones:)

I think that the way Kalmus goes about reducing his emissions is wonderful. Many people talk the talk, but don’t walk the walk when it comes to the climate crisis. It’s just too convenient to drive around rather than bike. Also, especially in the California big cities, jobs tend to be 30-60 minutes away or more, making biking unreasonable. The fact that Kalmus was able to reduce his emissions so much is admirable and as he said, will show people that they can do the same. I don’t think his carbon fee would work. It would reduce the amount of carbon emitted, but as covered in previous lectures, we need to do a lot more than just reduce carbon emissions to fix the problem we’ve created.

I actually did not think about. My father has to drive at least one hour to get to work. He can't bike over there. That's why public transportation has to be free and easily accessible. Kalmus is a great guy and is very creative. Making his car run on vegetable oil was amazing to see. However he is only one man and it is sad that this government is not doing anything because they have the resources to fight the battle we face every day.

What I was most interested in these chapters out of Peter Kalmus’s book was his explanation of the benefits of a carbon fee. I am going to be honest, when the idea of a carbon fee was first brought to my attention I hated the idea and completely and totally disregarded it and while I still don't love it, I now see it as something that needs to be done. What Peter Kalmus said is true most people will not voluntarily change their lives to save the planet and this is one way that helps curve that. I doubt most republicans in congress and in the senate will bite right now, however, never say never. Also, I do like how it has been proven in British Columbia to actually raise the economy. The only problem I have with it is, what does this mean for jobs? As well as what does this mean for the lower class in the country? Will making carbon emitting companies pay a carbon tax mean laying off employees? Also how are those that are already struggling financially be affected by the rises in prices of things? Other than that I found Kalmus’s piece interesting and good read.

I think Peter Kalmus has contributed a lot in both personal action and being an climate activist. In the documentary “Being the Change”, he presents a kind of life style of very low carbon emission.  He plants and grows his own food for eating and his family use bike instead of cars. One thing that really impressed and surprised me is that he refitted his old car and allow it could power by plant oil. That is pretty cool. We can see that he is capable to have a much better and comfortable life with his knowledge and ability, but he chooses to live in a less convenient but low carbon emission style. This is the main reason why I esteem him. Also, beside personal action, Kalmus puts a lot of effort in changing the society. As shown in the documentary, he often attend some lectures and speeches to persuade people to reduce their carbon emission and promote a simple lifestyle. Moreover, he wrote a book named the same as “Being the Change” to suggest some solutions and ways to address the current problems. These solutions are really based on actual facts and statistics and are not blindly optimistic and unrealistic.



</p><hr>


<p>
I think Peter Kalmus’s story of how he effectively reduced his own carbon emissions by 1/10th of the average American is extremely inspiring. He also mentions how these actions have overall made him happier, contradicting the popular belief that efforts to mitigate the climate change will require difficult sacrifices that will worsen one’s life. While it is true there must be sacrifices, Peter demonstrates that it does not necessarily need to be a negative change. Out of the top 5 most impactful actions for Peter- quitting planes, vegetarianism, bicycling, freeganism, and composting- these all seem very practical and relatively easy to implement, except for maybe completely ending any air travel. I wish his story was more widely known because I think it would be beneficial for people to see firsthand how one person can make such a powerful impact on the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Most people believe their individual decision will not affect the environment, but Peter’s concrete numbers and statistics could help people realize how every effort counts. Furthermore, his story will prove that it is actually possible for people to bring about this type of change in their life without being excessively rich.

I completely agree with you. I also believe that his story is very inspiring because it not only shows that every persons actions matter but it also proves that these changes are possible. While many people argue that they can not do a certain change because it is incontinent to do so. I think that these changes such as riding a bike although can not be an option for people who commute for long distances to work this doesn't mean it should be rejected entirely. So maybe you cant bike to work. But you can certainly bike to your friends house who lives 2 miles away. Just because it cant bike everywhere does not mean you shouldn't try to bike at all because even those few times you are able to make a difference. Every effort towards saving the planet help and this is something that people should keep in mind.


<br><hr>
I also am inspired by the actions Kalmus took to reduce his carbon emissions by that much because he is proving it is not only possible for others to do the same, but that it also creates a life of purpose. Kalmus used statistics, research, and science to back up why the actions he takes are beneficial to our planet. I find it crazy how much of our carbon footprint can be reduced and how small changes, like using a clothesline instead of drier, can significantly reduce your carbon footprint. Because we are only allotted 2 metric tons of carbon a year, as individuals we need to look at what actions we are taking that contribute to our emissions and reduce these actions. I like how Kalmus expressed personal change as opposed to a lot of technological and political change because a lot of the time those things seem out of our control. Kalmus says we can make a personal decision to become climate activists, and that this personal action when combined with a large collective group can have serious power. I also think it was smart of him to use concrete numbers and statistics, because by proving and backing up your points by showing how much your carbon footprint is reduced when you commit to making a change. I also agree that the 5 actions Peter said were the most influential are really not asking that much. I however would also have a hard time not using air travel because I am from the east coast but I do think that doing 4/5 of these actions is still very beneficial. Even if someone does one of these actions, like going vegetarian, they will still be making a large reduction in their climate footprint. Kalmus's story proves that these changes are possible and also very rewarding.



<br><hr>


I couldn't agree more with your response. Kalmus’s main point is that lessening his carbon emissions truly created a new lifestyle. I found it inspiring that he included the statistics, confronting the popular belief that its "okay" not to make drastic cuts in your life, as it wouldnt make a difference anyway. Reading the piece made me think about the film we watched on the first week, where DiCaprio visited a farm (I believe). I remember how they emphasized the fact that cutting out beef and substituting it for chicken created such a huge difference in your carbon footprint. 
   <br><br>
I definitely agree with you and Kalmus that cutting out carbon emissions from our lives  is not as bad as it seems. I believe that while the change might not be the most comfortable thing, it definitely is the best one for your health, well-being, and mentality. For example, I have dedicated myself to a life of veganism starting last year. I will agree that the change was not easy at all, as I was leaving behind so many comfort foods and foods I was used to. I went into it thinking that it would be negative, but the effects were definitely the opposite. My body had felt so much better, and my mind had felt so much clearer. I was able to start thinking so much more critically, without the mental fog of my past eating behaviors.



</span></div><hr>

<p>

Chapter 9 reinforces the fact that the food you choose to eat impacts your carbon footprint so much. If you choose to go vegetarian, the amount of CO2 you release in a year will go down by a half, and then another 30% if you go vegan. In addition, if you create zero food waste, it will help your footprint a lot, too. It says that 3% of Americans are vegetarian and half of that 3% is vegan. In 2020, I think the number has gone up significantly, as people are realizing the health benefits as well. People might think that 1.5 tons a year is not a significant decrease when looking at the average 20 tons for a typical American, but it is possible to decrease it down to 0.7 tons from 3 tons. For those who tend to waste a lot of food, it’s a great decrease. And if everyone in the country does their part, we will see a greater change.
   <br><br>
I know that it is sometimes hard to not waste food, especially when you are living alone and food goes bad quickly. What I learned as a college student is that you have to utilize the freezer well, and when shopping at Costco or buying things in bulk, split with a couple of friends. That way, you can save money and reduce waste.

Peter Kalmus explains that the largest part of his personal carbon footprint used to be flying. It had me reflect on all of my air travel. I do not claim I live a sustainable life. I still own a car, stopped eating beef, bike whenever I can, and buy less stuff. However, little things in the household like not having an AC are things that my family has not adapted to. I also have millions of miles under my belt in my lifetime. I have to fly back to Santa Barbara after every break. Also, every annual family vacation has been accomplished via plane. Coming from Hawaii, slow travel is not really feasible. Hawaii is the place that I was born and raised and I do have plans to return there after school, but I understand that by choosing to live there, I will have to accept the fact that I will not be able to do slow travel and must fly less if I want to truly make a difference in my climate footprint. I have not calculated my footprint, but I already know flying is my top contributor like Peter Kalmus. He made a great point about how planes are an easy place to get sick. He mentions that “modern air travel is the ideal way for a local outbreak to spread into a pandemic.” This got me even more anxious than I already am about the coronavirus. Some people say that we should be just as worried as the normal flu while others are self quarantining in Seattle. My friend at UW got an alert that her classes are cancelled for the rest of the quarter and online classes will be given instead, as well as online finals. This outbreak seems to be getting more serious very quickly.  Universities in California and elsewhere are gearing for a transition to online learning in light of this possible pandemic. This is making me feel scared to board a plane at this time. I had plans to go to New York for spring break, but now I am second guessing everything, and I know other students have cancelled flights due to the contamination of airports. It is crazy how it is easier for everyone to consider not flying when a pandemic is on the line, whereas the simple fact that flying silently is hurting our planet does not seem to outweigh making plans to begin with.

Lauren sharing her reflection about air travel also made me take an introspective dive into my own sustainability efforts. Since my sister lives across the country in Illinois, I’ve only taken the time to visit her twice in the past decade that she’s lived there. On the other hand, my parents have taken multiple trips themselves, and while they are a lot more conservative in their habits than me, it’s a bit disheartening to see how impactful air travel is towards one’s carbon footprint. It’s not even like they’re doing it out of luxury either. My parents are genuinely concerned with helping my sister with raising her newly born son and daughter. I can handle being away from my family, so air travel isn’t really an issue for me, but I can see how it may be somewhat of a necessity for families who feel the need to provide help for one another
   <br><br>

On the topic of the current pandemic, I still can’t bring it to my head how some people are acting so naive. I remember seeing a few days ago tweets about millenials feeling the need to book flights to suit their traveling desires because of how much flight tickets have dropped since the pandemic has gained attention. These same millenials are likely the same ones who push for so much progressive change, and I wonder if they would still feel the same if they knew how disastrous air flight is for the Earth. To add on to this, some people are also angered over how festivals in the near future will likely be cancelled entirely if the pandemic worsens. It’s pretty sad to see how emotionally riled these people get over everything but their own health & the health of the planet.

I felt that Kalmus' book was much better and more informative than his documentary. It does a great job going in-depth about everything that an individual can do to help the environment. I liked the fact that he emphasizes that the changes people need to make to help the climate crisis varies from person to person. He acknowledges that everybody lives a different life. This stood out to me because most our reading this quarter talks about how everyone needs to cut down driving or traveling by a certain amount, but some people don't fly, so how could they cut down even more? 
   <br><br>
It was also nice to see actual examples and statistics regarding how someone cut down their carbon emissions. A great deal of readings and films always talk about what someone can do to help the environment, but they never really mention the how much impact it will have or if it is even achievable. Knowing that someone was able to cut down emissions and still maintain the life that he wants gives me hope for what we can all do to help the environment. 
   <br><br>
I enjoyed the fact that Kalmus included proposals and examples of collective action as well. There is only so much that one individual can do for the planet. I specifically liked the sections about carbon tax and cap-and-trade. Some of our readings and videos have touched on these subjects but have not fully explained what they are and how they would help. For instance, I was surprised to read that cap-and-trade is probably not the best way to encourage a reduction of emissions. From what I had head it seemed to be ok, but Kalmus was able to show me that it is not the most effective. Most people also talked about a carbon tax not a carbon fee. I did not realize that a fee even an alternative to a tax, but now I see that it is probably one of the best ways to save the planet.

Just as you said, I was not even aware about the difference between a carbon tax and a carbon fee until I read the Collective Action chapter. I believe that if this information was more well-known, and the fact that this fee would not be a tax was emphasized, the government and the people would be more likely to be in favor of it. Not only does the money go back to the people, which would benefit the general public, but it would also put money back into the economy, which aligns with the government’s goals. Most importantly, it would cause a natural society wide transition away from fossil fuels. I think that this is one of the biggest ways that we could cause a large-scale impact on a collective level.



   <br><br>

On the other hand is the Leaving Fossil Fuel chapter which focuses on individual action. I also particularly liked the fact that Kalmus has actual examples and statistic about the changes that we can make. He tested out his predictions about reducing emissions and managed to show the world that it was possible to do so and maintain a happy and rewarding life. I also liked the way he structured his book by (1) introducing the issue (2) using facts to provide evidence and (3) showing how to act on the issue with a personal example.


<br><hr>
 I completely agree with you about the carbon fee. If more people know about what it was and how it would impact not only the environment but society as a whole, more people would support it. From everything that I have heard about it, it seems like there would be almost no downsides to accepting this fee. Hopefully in the near future, we will see more coverage about the idea and eventually get it passed. This would be a huge step in the right direction.
   <br><br>
I also enjoyed the chapter where Kalmus focuses on individual action. It was really nice to see that individual action can be achieved. Many people say that changing their individual lives is not possible and will be too difficult, but Kalmus proves them wrong. He is able to have an environmentally friendly lifestyle while still living a typical suburban life. Nothing changed.

Kalmus is the kind of person everyone should strive to be. I love his point about how important it is to align your actions with your principles. While a single individual’s reduction of carbon emissions may not make a big dent in the climate crisis, it feels immoral to go around preaching climate activism when you don’t actually live the life you are advocating. This goes with all topics, not just climate change. It speaks to someone’s character when they practice what they preach. It is a great indicator of a person’s honesty. 
   <br><br>

I also loved Kalmus’s personal emissions calculator. With this information easily available we have no excuse to continue our high personal emissions. We can’t claim that we aren’t scientists and have no way of actually knowing how much we are emitting because we do have a way! As he said in his book, Kalmus is a fairly average American with a family and difficult job. If he can find the time to be more conscientious about his personal emissions, so can the rest of us.

I agree with you and believe that Peter Kalums is an admirable climate activist. I appreciated the section he included in this chapter on why he decided to reduce his emissions of fossil fuels. I was also most struck by his second reason: he wanted to align his actions with his principles. I think that this lends credibility to his claims. If he just said that everyone should fly less and transition to a primarily plant-based diet, yet still flew around the world eating big mac’s, there is no way that anyone would take his advice. What I like about Peter is that he practices what he preaches but he also practices it in a way that is inviting and accepting. 

   <br><br>

I also appreciated how Peter Kalums is extremely relatable. Just like you said, he is a normal American with a career and a family to support. He describes that in the past, his carbon footprint was similar to the average Americans. However, he was able to change his lifestyle and dramatically reduce his carbon emissions, proving that it is possible and that it does not correlate to a bland and depressing life. In addition to being relatable himself, Peter uses different forms of communication methods to relate to others. For instance, his movie Being the Change: Live Well and Spark a Climate Revolution, offers viewers an intimate experience with him and his family on their journey to decrease their carbon footprint. This may appeal to someone who is interested in relationships, happiness, sustainability, etc. On the other hand, this book is filled with more facts and statistics that may appeal to someone who is more oriented towards numbers.

Kalmus is an average American with a family and a job but still manages to find a better and more sustainable lifestyle. I agree with Aurora that it is reassuring to see someone practice what they preach. Kalmus not only encourages others to live a more sustainable life but also lives one himself. He is like most Americans who have an average life with a family and a job which some could say that living the way he is preaching isn't possible. However, he reinforces his claim by actually living the life that he preaches which is reassuring to other people. Most people are willing to put a face on and say they support a more sustainable life but fail to do so themselves. Thus, it was reassuring to see that people's words still mean something and they are living by what they say. I also found it surprising that even with the things that he had to cut back like transportation and food he is still able to enjoy his daily routine. For some people, giving up the lifestyle they have always been accustomed to wouldn't be to applying, but Kalmus was able to change his lifestyle and still enjoy it. It shows that people are willing to change and that a sustainable life is something that we can all strive to achieve.



<br><hr>
Practice what you preach, and like what everyone in these replies have said, it's great to see how Peter Klamus is able to put climate change action into serious practice. If a climate scientist won't lead by example, who will? For Peter to change the way he lived and still be content just shows how much closer we can get to happiness, and the correlation between greenhouse gas emissions and happiness overall. I admire his straightforwardness with some aspects people tend to be concerned about, such as in Chapter Nine regarding offsets, he states how, "Offsets allow people to assuage their guilt and continue flying." Just as Raul said above, people will put this face on of helping the environment, but are they really helping? With carbon offsets, is it really helpful? It's easier for people to turn a blind eye on a subject, or as soon as an easy "solution" comes up, they follow that solution instead of practicing more efficient and arguably less corrupt methods. When we live sustainably, we're not feeling guilty of contributing to greenhouse gases and thus we can lead a happier life.

I liked the way Peter Kalmus presented our personal environmental impacts. Rather than saying certain actions like eating meat is bad for the environment, he gave real numerical values to the damage we are causing. For example, by going vegan Peter Kalmus reduced his carbon emissions by 1500 kilograms of CO2 per year. These numbers give reference to the impacts our lifestyles have. Without numbers, it is difficult to visualize the importance of reducing our carbon emissions and the impact it will have. 
   <br><br>
Also, it made me aware of our privilege here in America. Our carbon emissions are so much higher than the rest of the world because of the lifestyle we live. But in other parts of the world, most of the population do not live the lifestyles that the majority of our population live.

I found this book is way more useful than the documentary. Since I think the documentary is trying to fit the taste of audience, whereas the book is written for people who are truly care about the climate change and willing to make some difference. Unlike the drawdown project, which offers some solution that need the collaboration and support from policies, Peter’s own reduction is like a feedback when you try something. He tests the potential solution that individual can do and tells us how much Co2 can be reduced by each of solution. From his book, people can understand the composition of their own carbon footprint and find the unique practical solution. However, I don’t fully agree with the idea that fossil fuel is a market failure. Raising the price or carbon tax might not solve the problem. It true that people might consumer less fossil fuel when the price goes up, but we cannot ignore the fact that the development of modern society is supported by energy. Without appropriate substitution of fossil fuel, raising the price might lead to the disorder of society.

I agree that the book version of “Being the Change” was more useful than the documentary. While both the documentary and book provided valuable insight on the climate crisis, the content of the book was much easier to follow than the film itself. Personally, I thought that the documentary lacked a coherent focus and was all over the place. The way the documentary was filmed and put together made it hard to pay attention to the message being delivered. I also like how Peter incorporated his own lifestyle changes and the effects that those changes had into the book. It was fascinating to learn how simple changes to our daily lives can cut down our greenhouse gas emissions dramatically. By quantifying these changes, it helps to see that the changes we make actually pay off.

   <br><br>

It’s true that putting a carbon tax on fossil fuels won’t solve the problem of climate change nor deter some people from consuming less of it. However, this does not mean that we can’t slowly wean ourselves off of using fossil fuels. By gradually increasing the cost of fossil fuels, through carbon taxes or fees to reflect it’s true cost (i.e. external costs such as impact on human health, environment, climate change), we can make way for greener alternatives such as renewable energy. Nowadays, the price of solar PV and wind are dropping so there are alternative sources of energy out there. It is just up to us to decide on whether or not we want to tap into these other sources.

Peter Kalmus shows us that there are many ways that we can lower our carbon footprint. Kalmus does this by measuring his individual CO2 emissions in his everyday life. Conclusively, he finds that there are many behaviors that we would not consider to be enabling the climate crisis. For example, Peter states that he was initially not aware of how much his flying habits were responsible for his climate footprint. I think it is interesting to see a scientist’s take on the climate crisis through his personal actions. One thing however that I questioned in regards to his relatability to the general public, specifically those who make less than the average middle-class family was his positionality in society. Peter was able to accurately calculate his carbon footprint and find ways to lessen it because he is stable economically and because he is a physicist. I do not think that the average person will be able to afford 18,000 to eliminate CO2e in natural gases in their household. It is not that Peter cares more about lessening his climate footprint, but instead that he is able to make the investment. In addition, Peter was able to figure out how to maintain and create Maeby, a car that is fueled by used vegetable oil. These types of steps taken to lower his carbon footprint may not be attainable for those who are not middle class and those who do not have a PhD in physics. Nonetheless, I support Peter's effort in lowering his carbon footprint, we should just not get so wrapped up in focusing on others lowering their carbon footprint. 
   <br><br>

After watching Kalmus’s film, I was somewhat disappointed that he did not mention anything outside of individual change. I did not expect to find it either in the book as a result. As a result, I was relieved after reading “Collective Action.” Peter Kalmus mentions change on a wider scale, such as carbon fees in policy, fighting against fossil fuel subsidies, and fighting in court. Among his solutions, one of the most surprising things that I read was redistributing wealth. This solution may come across as radical since it asks for a reassessment of economic disparity. I nonetheless think it is one of the strongest solutions he offers. One thing that I do not agree with that Peter states is that global warming is a market failure; I believe that the market is working as intended, disregarding the environment and the consequences that result from their actions.

Hello thank you for your response! 
   <br><br>

I did not mean to undermine the importance of individual change. I think everyone who can, should engage in individual action. However, not everyone can do the same; poor people exist and lack of resources are evident in such poor communities. For example, AP environmental class was not offered at my school. That is an example of just one resource that people do not have access to. Another example is voting. Some spoke can’t vote because they are undocumented, ex felons, etc. Or for those who can can face disenfranchisement, such as Super Tuesday last night. People were kept in voting polls in Texas until 1am, in a lower income area of Houston. This is considerably different in wealthier areas. For example in IV, voting did not take more than one hour. Like there are individual actions we can take, there are also individual resources or lack of thereof that greatly influence our actions. One thing that our professor talked about was the American culture of individualism. If we focus on this too much, we can forget about the overlapping  nature of social , environmental , and climate justice on a wider scale. Professor Ken mentioned that personal and collective action both overlap so one should not be ignored, such as ignoring those who are unable to lower their climate footprint because it doesn’t apply to them. 
   <br><br>

I do think looking at individual actions can be refreshing and everyone should do their best to minimize their footprints, but some of it can’t apply to poor people. For example, flying and transportation; some people don’t have cars and have never stepped foot on a plane. Kalmus has engineers in his neighborhood that can fix toasters on their free time. His wife is able to take his children to school; some children have to take the bus, and others take hours on public transportation just to get to school. I still feel as if Kalmus is in his own middle class suburban bubble. I personally did not find some of his actions relatable, and I feel like some poor or lower income people in class did not either. Perhaps it is a relatable film for those who have a large carbon footprint and fly, have their own car, spend a lot of money of purchasing material possessions etc. I think it was an interesting film, but I feel like it took place in another world. I appreciate that you mentioned the importance of individual action because maybe I need to clarify that I don’t think it’s insignificant.

For me the most doable fixes that Peter proposed are biking, flying, and drying clothes. Even if you have a job that you need to commute to, you can still bike around town to reduce your carbon footprint and reduce traffic congestion in your respective town. Cities and towns should invest in more safe bike infrastructure, as many people don't bike because it is dangerous. E-bikes are also a good option for those who can afford them. You can get around town just as easy if not easier (no traffic) on an e-bike than you can in a car. For flying, people just need to accept the fact that it is terrible for the environment. I don't expect people to stop flying altogether, but I think people should limit their air travel to once or twice a year if they can. As for dryers and other appliances, a little bit of manpower goes a long way. taking the extra 10-15 minutes to hang your clothes up instead of drying them will save a ton of electricity in the long run. Another thing I think we as students can do is talk to our friends and family about the little things they can do everyday. We can only operate in the system we have been placed in, and seeing as no one person can alter the worldwide fossil fuel economy, you should just do what you can.

I think that Rackmill does a commendable job of analyzing Kalmus’ reading in a way that most Americans would be able to understand and relate to in some form. As Rackmill points out, three of Kalmus’ proposals are biking, flying, and drying clothes. Two of these, biking and drying clothes, are not hard at all. E-bikes are a good option; as Hiltner explained in one of his videos, he rides his E-bike to and from work and the total travel time is actually similar to what it was when he drove his car to and from work. The reasons for this are that the E-bike is actually pretty fast and that traffic in Santa Barbara is really bad. It will be much harder, however, for Americans to stop flying. There are no real alternatives to flying and it is sad that flying emits so much CO2e into the atmosphere. Lastly, I was incredibly interested by Kalmus’ positive analysis of CFAD. The idea of revenue neutrality is so simple yet such an amazing idea. The benefits to CFAD are numerous and I believe that we must implement CFAD policies as soon as possible and see how they work.

<p>
I think it’s ridiculous the amount of greenhouse gases Americans release into the atmosphere. We know it’s possible to reduce our emissions because countries with many more people than us still have lower greenhouse gas emissions. We’re so materialistic and selfish when it comes to the Earth. We want what makes life easier but at the same time we’re killing the world. Our social benefit could be greatly increased if we just cut down our emissions. In Kalmus’ book, he did an excellent job of explaining ways we can reduce our gas emissions. The one thing I found a bit strange is that he said you don’t have to sacrifice a lot. Which I disagree with. I think what Kalmus is doing is great but he can’t say he lives a “normal” life when he plants in his own waste. That’s not normal and I would certainly consider the time and mental health that would take away from me. Many of the things he suggests require you to sacrifice time or money. I’m not saying we shouldn’t be doing these things, I’m just saying it’s not true that it doesn’t require sacrifice because it definitely does. Except, on the other hand, your sacrifice does give you a future benefit of a healthy planet. So while it’s crazy to think you won’t have to sacrifice anything, at least you will still gain a benefit for your sacrifice.

Peter is truly and icon and needs to be shown and heard by more people. Not only is he a respected scientists, but he presents the crisis as a problem and not only gives, but shows the solution. The man is a living example of what every american could be doing to help the Earth and explains what needs to be done on a national scale. For starters, I love the idea of a carbon fee, not a carbon tax. By not being a tax, it can be directly given back to americans as Peter says and, if it is evenly split, then would benefit lower incomes more. Getting a couple thousand dollars from the government every year, I think would be pretty cool. I also want to note the court case Peter brought up. I had no idea this was happening, and I find it very exciting and proof that the next generation (us) can have an impact on what is occurring in our country. Overall, I fully agree with Peter's mind set, personal action and political action are necessary, we need to show it can be done, and get people follow. The problem being there are things out of our direct control, and that is where the political action takes place.

This week’s readings were interesting in the way that he spoke of his personal life but also included his own opinions as a human, not a scientist, and spoke of activism and acts we could all do. “Leaving Fossil fuels” was interesting to read and see how he made cuts in his personal life in order to live in a more economically friendly way of life and how he cut his carbon footprint to be 1/10 of the average american’s carbon footprint. However I did like how he said that his chart of emissions would not look like everyones elses because of course we all live different lifestyles. In “Collective Action” I completely agreed with his quote of, “It’s quite remarkable that the US, a country that prides itself as a shining beacon of freedom and enlightened rationality, is pulling the world down into the depths of climate disaster” and I think that basically summarizes this entire country.

You are so right!  It is really inspiring to see how Peter Kalamus made these changes in his life, especially working to cut out fossil fuels.  I think it is so cool how he has his car Maeby that runs primarily on waste vegetable oil.  It really shows how creative people can get when finding solutions to the climate crisis and how they can minimize their impact on the environment.  If he is able to figure this wonderful contraption out, then the possibilities of the rest of the world putting their minds together to find more solutions are endless.  If we are able to do this then I am optimistic about our situation because there are so many creative and  intelligent individuals who have the potential to make groundbreaking discoveries that can greatly impact our situation.
    <br><br>

Again with the quote you pulled from “Collective Action” in the reading, I agree with you that it perfectly summarizes the United States.  We pride ourselves on being a world leader and inspiring greatness, but all we have done is get us into this messy situation with our terribly harmful habits that we have kept too long.  We need to stop being the force of climate disaster in the world, and we need to be who we say we are by making the vital changes within our country together so that we drastically decrease our climate impact.  It is only right as we are the ones who have been and continue to make the climate crisis worse with our detrimental ways.


<br><hr>
I agree, I strongly believe that implementing his ideas as a normal person with a normal life along with his scientific views was very important because it allows the average human being to relate to and to truly understand the steps taken and the positive effects that they have on life. I enjoyed reading this because I didn’t think it was even possible to reduce one’s carbon footprint by 1/10 and not only does he make it possible he also demonstrates that in doing so he lives a happier and fulfilled life. I think that the most interesting aspect to change for less CO2 emissions was the compost and renewables; considering the fact that of personal emissions ⅔ comes from food waste and from non-recycled paper. I also agree that it was important that he mentioned that not everyone’s chart would look the same because we do all have different lives and it’s important to recognize that no matter what you choose to do to help the environment it will make a change. Within the collective action portion of his book I think that it was important to add this because we really all have to work together in order for there to be a larger change.

<br><hr>
Yes, I feel the same. Peter Kalmus explain to us what people could do by introducing his personal life toward the climate crisis. I also admire that you have calculated your daily footprint. I am so surprised that Peter Kalmus made a detailed estimation of his carbon emissions and have a real plan on how to reduce carbon emissions. Many people feel shocked to the climate crisis and say to themselves that they want to make a change. They do not in fact. Peter Kalmus is the one who makes a real change. Peter Kalmus calculated clearly on his daily consumptions of carbon dioxide. One of the estimates for carbon emissions is on air travel. He acknowledges that he results in 16 metric tons of CO2. Also, he claims that he prefers “slow and adventurous travel to fast travel”. Flying less is his mission. What’s more, Peter Kalmus concludes his carbon consumptions on car travel, methane, food, electricity, staff, waste, buses, trains, and every else. I appreciate what Peter Kalmus have done. I’ve no nobody who can summarize daily carbon emissions and put in effect. I’ve learned how to make my own estimate and have a change in order to reduce carbon emissions. I can start with planes: multiplying my annual miles…etc. This is an instructive method for people like me who never estimate footprints.

It seems simple right, 5 simple things you can do or we can do as a community and that’s it! Our planet is saved! 5 simple things: 1. Quitting Planes, 2. Vegetarianism 3. Bicycling, 4. Freeganism, 5. Composting. Simple right? Wrong! IT IS hard, these things are extremely hard to do, they are not a simple boycott this brand or stop using this product, it involves a complete shift in our daily lives and a change in the inherent way that we are living. I’m not going to lie here, as much as I wanna say that I am going to quit taking planes and take a boat overseas every year to see my family, I just don’t think that is going to happen. But I know for a fact I can start eating in more climate-conscious ways, I can waste less food, and I can forgo taking my car and instead riding my bicycle. In fact, living here is IV has given me a serious appreciation for using a bicycle as my main mode of transport. I realized that it really isn;t that difficult and it is quite beneficial if you think about it in the long run. You are getting constant exercise while you don’t even realize you’re exercising, you are saving the environment and you seldom get stuck in traffic jams or crazy traffic at anytime of the day! It’s great! And completely worth leaving your house a few minutes early to make it on places on time. 
   <br><br>

One thing that struck me and keeps striking me every single time I hear about it, read about it or listen to it is how big of an impact food has on our planet. It is kind of ironic if you think about it, that the thing that we need to survive and to flourish, is also the thing that is one of the greatest reasons for all our problems and worries. The food industry is the 2nd largest climate contributor in the world and is responsible for around ⅓ of global greenhouse gas emissions, half of which (15% of global emissions) is due to livestock, mainly cows. Producing food for meat eaters (like me) emits around 3,000kg of CO2 a year, whereas it only emits half of that for a vegetarian diet and ⅓ for a vegan diet. That’s insane just by changing the way we eat, the way we prepare, waste, utilize our food could save our planet! That is something that every individual can do, no need for large companies or politicians to make the change for us, there are alternatives, this is a way that everyone from all over the world can genuinely make a difference.

<p>

One major topic discussed in this class is the fact that personal action is very important. This concept was discussed again in “Being the Change.” We all need to do our part to lessen our carbon emissions. This has become something that I think about on a daily basis. There is definitely more I can do. As Ken mentioned, the use of a clothesline is effective. I grew up with my mother using one when I was growing up. While writing this, I just realized that I’m not in the habit of air-drying my clothes anymore. If one is able to utilize a clothesline, one should take advantage of it. That is just another small example, though. I truly believe that the most important thing we can do is vote for politicians who support the green agenda. We need people who genuinely care about the environment to be making the calls. Climate change is a big issue that needs an even bigger solution.

The reading was 100% better than the film. It made sense, convinced me and not cultish. Some changes that I wish to change about my life is to bike more. Yes I bike everywhere now but that is only because I live in Isla Vista and go to UCSB. There is no need for me to have a car. When I grow up I want to be able to bike to work, have my kids walk to school and be able to shop locally from farmers markets. All of these lifestyle changes seem so easy and life fulfilling. Another thing I want to try is composting. My grandparents have always but that's because I think they are retired and have “more time” but I fee1 like this composting idea wouldn’t take that much time at all. I think it would actually be fun!
     <br><br>
Another argument I was impressed by was the carbon fee. I have always heard of the carbon tax but not the carbon fee. Carbon fee sounds like it would also be liked by everyone, not just liberals. This fee would help transition to renewables and at the same time help low income communities. This fee would also help it get passed since people are always weary of a tax.

I really enjoyed reading Peter Kalmus’ book because he talks about personal changes which are for the most part, attainable. I related most to his passion for gardening and composting. My mom is an avid gardener, so I can definitely relate to how impactful gardening and composting are on the environment. Our backyard is barely accessible anymore because it’s filled with vegetables and fruit trees. When you walk to our front door, you’re greeted by a brown chest. Inside are over 2,000 Red Wiggler worms which provide a lot of the compost used in our backyard garden. Most of our food waste is fed to these worms, which in turn provide healthy compost for the vegetables and fruits in our garden.

   <br><br>

In addition to our backyard garden, my mom rents a plot in the community garden in our city. As a result, my mom spends hours every day during the summer tending to her vegetable garden in our backyard and in her plot at the community garden. During the summer, we barely buy any produce from the store because it all comes from our garden. Everything is organic and better than any produce you can buy. I’m constantly bringing boxes of heirloom tomatoes to our neighbors and friends because we have way too much for just our family. Not only is a backyard garden beneficial for the environment, you along with your friends and family can enjoy the tasty benefits as well.
   <br><br>

Peter Kalmus is an avid gardener as well. However, he includes humanure into his compost. We have to realize that we don’t have to make choices as extreme as that in order to help the environment. An easy backyard garden with compost made from food waste and leaves is enough to make an impact, even if it’s small.

Hi Sydney!! I really enjoyed reading your comment about your backyard back home. I personally have never tried gardening and don't have any family or friends that do so either, but hearing about the one you and your mom created made me become more open to the idea of planting one in the future. I thought it was very cool of you to share your own personal experience with composting and growing your own food. I too see the connection to Peter Kalmus's story and that it is important to realize that we don't have to make as extreme choices in order to make a difference. I think your story was a wonderful example of how taking relatively small steps towards change can still have big benefits.
   <br><br>

I also wanted to address the way that Peter defined quantification in his chapter titled, "Leaving Fossil Fuel". Quantification is the expression of measurement of the quantity of something and Kalmus described it as something that "shattered my preconceptions and shined a bright light onto my ignorance." To think that by simply taking note of how much we consume, use, and abuse on a daily basis, could change our lives so dramatically, is so exciting to me. I think this is very possible and although it may be harder for some to accomplish, we are all capable of becoming more conscious of our daily life choices. In order for our personal actions to truly make a difference, we need to become more aware of our actions (carbon footprint) and exactly how they are affecting others and our planet. It is one thing to say you want change and another to actually make the changes in your life to see the change. As Peter Kalmus says, " Daily life is a series of choices; in US society, many of these choices lead to fossil fuels. " We are going to need quantification and a little creativity in order to change this statistic. Also, we are going to need perseverance and each other's support in order for our actions to truly make a difference. As long as we keep pushing each other to vote and take personal action, we will continue on the right track and I am very optimistic of our future. Happy Voting Day!

I'm interested to hear that your mom rents a plot in the community garden! When I used to live in a house, my family also grew many of our own vegetables and I remember enjoying the process of gardening a lot. After we moved to an apartment in LA, we don't do any gardening anymore and I really miss it. Not only is it fun, growing your own food at home reduce carbon emissions and saves money. I am inspired by both Kalmus and your comment to actively find community gardens and start composting in my home. Although I don't think I will be down to compost with humanure, my family throws away a lot of food scraps that can easily be reused as compost instead of going to waste. 


I am also inspired by other lifestyle changes that Kalmus makes at home to reduce his family's carbon footprint, such as drying clothing on a clothesline rather than using a dryer. It's amazing that Kalmus reduced his CO2 emissions by more than a thousand pounds just by doing this. Using a drying rack or a clothesline seems like such an easy way to reduce carbon emissions because it requires so little effort, and it saves money compared to going to the laundromat. Although it's difficult to do in a small dorm room shared by 3 people, I will definitely try to do this when I go back home.

I think it is so cool how much gardening you and your family do and I think that so much, in addition to reducing climate impact, can come out of growing your own food. While gardening and composting is good for the environment, it is also really fun and honestly rewarding. Growing up I did not get the same opportunity of having a garden because my house was surrounded by six sycamore trees which blocked any sunlight from reaching my yard. We  attempted many times to grow some tomatoes in the one little section of my yard that got sun for  a part of the day, but it never worked out. I wish my parents had known about and participated in community gardens because that sounds like a really fun way to grow good, local and organic food while also having positive impacts on the environment and building a sense of community. 
    <br><br>
I think that gardening is just one example of how living a more sustainable life can mean a happier and healthier life as well. I became a vegetarian when I started going to school here in the fall and not only do I feel healthier and better after eating, I also feel happier about what I am doing for the environment as well as for my own body. Also, I didn’t bring my car here so I only ride my bike or occasionally take the bus when I have to go long distances. While it can be somewhat inconvenient at times to not have a car when you need to run a quick errand or go on a hike, overall I feel a lot better about my personal environmental impact when I ride my bike everywhere. Biking is also a really good and fun way to exercise. Also, finding new ways to be more sustainable and eco-friendly can be a fun adventure and a learning curve. Obviously, we aren’t all able to start running our cars on waste vegetable oil or completely quit flying , but we can find our own ways that will help improve our own personal footprint and make us feel good about doing what we can individually for the planet. 
    <br><br>
Kalmus is such a good example of how we are all capable of doing our best to decrease our carbon footprint. We all make up excuses for reasons why we can’t be more sustainable, but it is important to realize that it really is possible to become more sustainable without spending more money or working any harder. It is less about buying things to make life more sustainable and more about thinking more consciously about our choices and lifestyles.

Personally, I really enjoyed this reading for the reason that it could be tailored to the person. Like Ken mentioned in the video, everything that we have been talking about concerning lowering emissions have been so general and so drastic. While Kalmus does take a more drastic change like freeganism he shows how a lot of things can be practical. The most amusing to me was the clothesline as Ken mentions in the video, never did I even think that a clothesline could emit less and let alone make such a difference. I also found it really interesting how to calculate our own emissions. While that's not the most practical thing to do while on-campus housing, this is definitely something I want to try when I am back home for the summer. Not only can I help my family reduce household emissions but I can show them and educate them about emissions and the climate crisis as a whole- I mean isn't that the point of this class to widespread the information? Overall I thought the reading was really interesting and I am ready to implement it into my own life- although the flying is still going to be a really tough one to grasp.

Peter is amazing. The idea involved in the reading “Being the Change” is not a new material for me. I’ve read a lot of the same information in previous sources. But I also learned a lot from Peter’s reading. This week’s film is also about happiness, and Peter also incorporated how his personal actions make his happiness connected to climate issues. Besides, Peter also provided new insights on how we can solve climate problems. Getting ideas from carbon fee policy from British Columbia, Peter suggested that we can actually try this out since it has successfully worked in British Columbia. It has proven to be the right way. Reading through all the contents provided by Peter, it is really encouraging and impactful. He is calling for actions in his own way as a potential leading figure. And as the final election run is approaching, all we can do now as a whole is to vote for Democratic candidates who will for sure stand for solving climate crisis.

Xinmeng I agree with your comment about how enjoyable Peter Kalmus “Being the Change” readings were and how they were connected with happiness. While Peter was trying to lower emissions and was explaining how much of a difference some little things can make, I thought it was most interesting that Peter worries about climate change from more of a personal view. He really cares about the effects that he's causing on the earth, he’s not really doing it for any other reason other than that he believes it is the right thing to do, and I can respect him for that. He was able to break down his carbon emission footprint and showed us where he was emitting the most carbon and what he could do about it. Interestingly enough, taking flights was one of the largest sources of his carbon emissions, even though not many people take flights. It’s usually people who are frequent fliers for business trips that emit a lot of these greenhouse gases. Peter is able to show us that individual changes can make a big difference, even if many of us don’t think so. Once again I think this relates back to the whole idea of mindset. Many people don’t think that what they do or the changes they make don’t make a difference. However, Kalmus shows us the opposite, that one person can make drastic changes in their CO2 output. If everyone had this mindset, the world would be in a much better place.

I also appreciate how the reading and film both explore happiness and both conclude the same thing: we can consume less and do better for the planet and actually be happier. The information about British Columbia stood out to me too because an example of a successful carbon fee is great support for pushing for one in the U.S. or anywhere else. It also represents the potential for economic growth in this fight for the climate which is appealing to conservatives who don't generally support regulations in the name of combatting the climate crisis. I agree that the information presented by Peter is very encouraging and impactful, particularly because of how personal it all is. I appreciate that he emphasizes that his footprint is different from other people's and that he provides the resources for people to figure out their own. He writes "let's go after things that actually matter." Individually, we can only go after the things that matter most when we have an understanding of how we are contributing the most to CO2 emissions and that varies from person to person and country to country. There is no one best lifestyle.

Humans are destroying Earth, but just like that they also have the power to restore it and come back from this progressive mistake. People can get together and protest against those with power who continue to destroy the environment for profit. Together we can try and stop the notion that nature is only for money generating usage. 
   <br><br>
Peter Kalmus in Being the Change, attempts to uncover the importance of individual action. Peter Kalmus decided to change his lifestyle for the sake of his children, he wanted a better world for them. Climate change is affecting all life on the planet, Kalmus wants his children to experience life on Earth without the worry of an end. Kalmus has a philosophy he follows which involves the head, hands, and heart. The head is for realizing from an intellectual, scientific point of view that there is a problem. Once the problem is recognized we can take action with our hands. The hands are used for gardening, fixing old objects, riding a bike, and much more. The heart ties the head and hands together. The heart is where meaning is found in making life more satisfying. In conclusion, taking part in environmentally friendly things equals a happier, more meaningful life. 
   <br><br>

One person alone can not make a huge change, but many individuals linked together certainly can. What I learned from the reading is that each of us individually can stop emitting fossil fuels by shifting our current culture. By building awareness we can have an effect on each of our local communities and the people around us. As we change ourselves, we can simultaneously explore how best to use our growing awareness, empowerment, and connection to steer collective change. In summary, individual action is as important as a collective action.

I agree with you completely in the sense that we are destroying the planet and have the power to fix our mistakes. Many people hear about climate change and are immediately off-put by the concept. The problem seems larger than humans; however, it is not. If every individual takes it upon themselves to try and only emit 2 tons of carbon, we can start healing the planet. Yes. This task is going to be a large change to the normal Westernized life we Americans live. But, without a change, there will be no place for us to live. As you mentioned, Peter Kalmus stated that he wanted a better world for his children to live in and if we don't make a change there will be no habitable world for future generations.
   <br><br>


So how do we try to have a life where we only emit 2 tons of carbon? What does that even mean?
   <br><br>
Peter Kalmus, teaches us the ways to create a positive impact. He has taken it upon himself to change his ways: “I became vegetarian, started growing food, and began obtaining much of my food from the waste stream (freeganism). I started composting aggressively, and biking became my primary mode of transportation.”  Many of his changes not only positively affect the environment, but they also made a positive impact on his own life. A life with less fossil fuel attributes to a life with less stress. Biking is a great alternative to any type of car. Not only does biking release no extra fossil fuel emissions into the atmosphere but it is also cheaper than owning a car because no gas has to be paid and there is not much upkeep. It is also a great source of exercise which reduces stress levels.

This materialistic life that we are currently living in is ruining the environment. People are buying clothes as quickly as they are being produced. This fast-fashion creates a large amount of waste in our environment. Peter mentioned that when we send stuff to landfills, it produces methane because it decomposes with no oxygen. When we buy and buy we are ultimately producing more methane. It is also stressful to have to keep producing money to spend. If the world didn't focus on this materialistic lifestyle people could work fewer hours which causes less stress and more time for hobbies or being with friends and family.

Be the change and be a positive impact on the environment.

I agree with your sentiment that we have the power to restore the earth just as easily as we have been destroying it. There is so much power in numbers. We need to make it a point to take back the damage we’ve done to our home and especially put an end to corporations that continue to add to the economic market failure that is climate change. Being the Change focuses on Peter Kalmus’ journey of individual action. This journey evidently shows how much individual action makes a huge difference when taking on the climate crisis. 
   <br><br>

As a scientist, he was extremely worried about the present danger of climate change in terms of a scientific point of view. He feared for not int his own life but for the future his children and family. I also agree that his philosophy of “head, hands, and heart” is a wonderful way of thinking about the climate crisis. Technological innovations will not help us, it will only make it worse. The world is literally in our hands. It only makes sense to fix the problems we’ve created with our hands as well like growing our own food, hand washing our clothing, fixing things in our houses so that we don’t have to keep buying new stuff. However, this can only work if the head and the heart are in the fight as well like you mentioned. We need to find out for ourselves how much our impact will affect not only the climate but also our private lives so we can discover the satisfaction behind helping the environment.

I completely agree with you. It is true that it is humans who destroy the earth, and it should be humans to save the world. There is an old saying in China：In order to untie the bell, the person who tied it is required. To overcome desire and greed, and for a sustainable tomorrow, humanity must work together now. Peter Kalmus, as a climate scientist, gives us a lot of solutions to mitigate the climate crisis (on individual level, not technological method). Although some solutions given by Peter, as many people mentioned, are a little bit outdated or impractical in some ways, I believe at least some of them can help inspire people. For example, I think meditation is a good way, not to mitigate the climate crisis directly but to change our internality. How can we work together to change the world if we did not persuade ourselves? I had kept meditating for months when I was in high school. I had a lot of homework, exams, and huge pressure during that period. However, I insisted meditate every night and I found it useful for me to calm down and figure out the real thing that I wanted. After taking meditation, I not only improved my study utility but also found out some unnecessary things which distracted me a lot. In today’s case, I believe that meditation can help us find out what indeed makes us happy. We need to make a sweeping change, from inside to outside, to mitigate the climate crisis. In this week’s reading, Peter gives us useful actions both on the individual level and the collective level. Moreover, as a climate scientist at the NASA jet propulsion lab, Peter offers us a significant way to measure our carbon footprint. As a result, we can have a more intuitive feeling for the impact of our daily actions on the planet.

I agree with you that it’s definitely important to realize that even though it may not seem like a lot when we’re doing things individually, it does still make a huge impact on the planet. I highly admired how very passionate and dedicated Peter was to reducing his carbon footprint and the carbon footprint of his family. It could not have been easy to make all the sacrifices he did especially when he not only had to think about himself but he also had kids and a wife to keep in mind. However, call me too serious but i simply don’t think his whole idea about meditation will truly get us somewhere far. I know that people need to be aware of themselves and their waste just as he did to truly realize the impact they’re having even as one sole person. Yet, I think that this almost spiritual approach he took would only turn people away from the issue at hand and less people would take it seriously. His sharing of his experience and admitting that these changes were not easy and did not come quickly reassures me of the types of changes I;m currently trying to make because from him I’m learning that the sacrifices aren’t easy and therefore will be gradual. I say, a gradual change is much better than seeing no change at all from people.

I absolutely agree with your statement and also believe that we, the humans who collectively are responsible for climate change, can definitely work together to restore our earth from dying whether it may be through grassroots movements or lobbying or even protesting against deniers and greedy corporations. 
   <br><br>

Reading “Being the Change” was a lot easier to comprehend than watching the documentary. While the documentary allowed visuals and a deeper perspective in daily life, reading about it allowed me to fully absorb his message especially when he argued for carbon footprint reduction. Kalmus does admit that his actions alone will not contribute much impact in decreasing carbon emissions but rather than discouraging the riders about how much they can do, he instead writes about how much joy he gets from intentionally living without fossil fuels. Rather than driving, he takes time to ride his bike and thoroughly enjoys it and instead of local businesses wasting food, he takes them to use or eat. Activities like gardening or composting would be very enjoyable to do as a family, kids can learn how plants grow and eat it as well. It is very interesting that his lifestyle is based on philosophical beliefs (head, hand, and heart) and while he lives an unusual life compared to the average materialistic American, he is able to be a good father and family man despite initially being rooted in fears and worries for his children and the younger generations. Americans need to be educated on how their daily actions have these consequences that harm the earth. While climate change remains to be dealt with in a political environment, we, as students who are privileged enough to take a class about climate change at a UC, must create a cultural shift from the material “American Dream” that our parents dream about or have already achieved to the minimalist, reduced carbon footprint lifestyle that can hopefully bring restoration to the earth. On a political level, we must vote for environmentally progressive deals and vote for those who have an environmentally friendly agenda and policy. Like you commented, we can continue to explore alternatives to the things that we are so used to grow awareness.
